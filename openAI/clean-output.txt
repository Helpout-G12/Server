question: My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy. However, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?
answer: It sounds like there's a lot of tension between your wife and mother. It might be helpful to have a conversation together about how to manage their differences in a healthier way. It could be beneficial to set some boundaries and agree on communication methods that promote understanding rather than argument. Having open, honest conversations where all parties are respectful and understanding of each other can help diffuse any potential tension before it arises."}

question: I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call. I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?
answer: It sounds like you are looking for a deeper connection but are not sure how to go about finding it or making it work once you have found it. The most important thing is to set boundaries and expectations, both in the relationship and with yourself. Setting clear boundaries of what is acceptable behavior will help you feel more secure that you are being respected as an individual, rather than someone who is just there to fulfill needs. It also helps create a space where both parties can engage in meaningful conversations and learn from each other. Additionally, recognizing and validating your own needs and wants is essential for finding a healthy balance. It might be helpful to talk through some of these ideas with a therapist to explore ways of making the necessary changes. Good luck on your journey!"}

question: It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I’d estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe. I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my father’s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning. After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?
answer: It sounds like you have gone through a lot of difficult changes recently which has caused an increase in your stress levels and consequently impacted your sleep. It is important to be aware of how stress affects your body, mind and spirit and develop strategies to cope with it. Exercise is one way to help reduce stress but I also recommend setting aside time each day to practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or yoga. Additionally, reaching out to a therapist may be helpful to process your thoughts and emotions in a safe space."}

question: What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parent's custody visitation?

It sounds like you have a lot of courage and strength to open up about this, and I am here for you if you need any further guidance or advice."}

question: Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family. However, now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children to get hurt. I'm not sure how to move forward?

There are also other steps you can take such as individual or couple counselling which could provide additional support."}

answer: It sounds like you are going through a lot of stress and anxiety. To help manage these symptoms, it might be helpful to practice relaxation techniques such as mindfulness or meditation. Additionally, make sure to get enough sleep and exercise regularly. Also, if the anxiety attacks persist for more than an hour, it would be beneficial to seek professional help."}

question: I have no sex drive due to medical issues. I’ve shut down completely and closed everyone out. I’ve even told my husband that I wanted a divorce since that’s what I thought he wanted to hear. However, it devastated me when I learned he's seeing someone else. I’ve since told him that I wanted to work things out but he’s not sure I actually mean it. He thinks the only reason I want him back is because I’m jealous. How do I show him I’m serious?
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It's important that you communicate clearly and honestly with your husband, so he knows you are sincere in wanting to work things out. Acknowledge his feelings, recognize the trust has been broken, and share with him what you can do to rebuild it. You may also want to consider couples counseling to help both of you process these difficult emotions and build a stronger foundation for your marriage."}

question: The last of my emotions belong to my pets. Today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow. If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says "here lays my emotions. R.I.P." I practically have no emotions left and I came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my family's. What's wrong with me?
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Is there anything specific that is causing stress or anxiety for you?}

question: Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together. It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again. She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind. I don't know what to do.
answer: I understand how painful this must be for you. It sounds like a lot has changed since the last time you spoke, with your girlfriend going to Missouri to visit her family. Have you talked about why she might have felt differently when she was there? Was there something specific that happened while she was there? How do you feel about the baby? Is this something you two had planned for or was it a surprise? Has she said why she doesn't love you anymore and if so, what did she say?"}

question: Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?
answer: It's understandable that you are feeling angry and distrustful. We can work together on identifying why you feel this way, as well as developing strategies to help you process your feelings in a healthy and productive manner."}

question: I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents. I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.
answer: It sounds like you are going through a difficult time. It is understandable that it would be hard to open up to your parents, since they may not understand the lifestyle choices you make or how you feel about them. Perhaps talking with someone who is more neutral and understanding could help alleviate some of these feelings. Have you ever considered talking with a therapist?"}

question: I have been with this guy on and off for 8 years. At first, we used to do things together and our sex life was ok. Then things started to change, we'd break up and reconnect, and he cheated on me numerous times. We've also had two beautiful baby girls during this time. Now we argue and he says I am not affectionate at all or I don't know how to please a man, when I work part-time, take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook. Sometimes he cooks, but he also spends a lot of time on the internet. In addition, I have 2 boys and he has 1 son. I feel somewhere I have lost something. It's not that I don’t care, I truly love this guy, but I'm just tired of being the one who is always being judged. Please, I am in need of a Christian counselor to help us because I really need to speak to someone.
answer: I understand how difficult it is to be in a relationship where there is not much unity and understanding. It seems like both of you are trying to do your best but things don’t seem to work out the way you want them to. You said that you have two beautiful baby girls and he spends most of his time on the internet. Is this something that you are concerned about? Does it affect your relationship in any way?" }

question: My son claims that hes been having extremely violent thoughts and dreams. Not violent like he's hurting someone, but violent thoughts like horrible things happening to his loved ones. He explained one of his dreams the other day and it was so violent it was sickening. It was far beyond anything in a horror movie, he says he can't help these thoughts they just pop up. Please help!
answer: I'm sorry to hear that your son is experiencing such disturbing thoughts and dreams. I understand how difficult this must be for both of you. Is there something we can do to help him process and cope with his thoughts? Do you think he might open up about them with a trusted adult, like a teacher or a pastor? Or maybe even someone in the mental health field?"}

question: Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.

question: I need to get on base to see my doctor. My ID card was in my wallet which was stolen. I’m unable to reach my husband at this time. He is only one who can take me on base in order to get a new ID so I can continue to see doctor. Is there anything I can do?
answer: I understand this is a difficult situation. You may be able to contact the hospital or clinic directly and ask if they can provide an exception to their policy, allowing you to be seen without your ID card. If that isn't possible, then you will need to try to get a new ID card as quickly as possible in order to maintain your health care.}

question: I’ve known my boyfriend for several years. We were friends for a long time. In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan. After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasn’t apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. I don’t know what to do.
answer: I am so sorry to hear all of this. It is clear that you have been going through a lot and are feeling very vulnerable right now. What happened with the other relationship was wrong and it appears as though your partner has not learned from this. You need to decide what is best for you in this situation, but I would suggest taking some time away from him to evaluate the relationship. If you want to talk further about what options may be available to you, please feel free to schedule another session with me."}

question: I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. I’m coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.
answer: It is normal and healthy to take time to adjust to a major life change, especially one as difficult as a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath. Everyone grieves differently and at their own pace. It may help to talk with someone about the loss you have experienced, as well as the changes in your life. Please know that you are not alone and that it is okay to ask for help when needed." }

question: I've been married for 3 years and I have two kids. During my 3-years married, my husband cheated on me twice. The second time really got to me and at my lowest I hurt him back. We aren't communicating as well as I would like. What do I do?
answer: It sounds like you have been through a difficult experience. It's understandable that you feel hurt, angry and frustrated with your husband. Communication is key in any relationship, and it seems like it could use some work between the two of you. How can I help?"}

question: I have been with my husband for almost 7 years. We got engaged a little after 5 years of being together. I had always been clear that I wanted to get married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose. When he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned. I was happy but I couldn't help feeling disappointed too. I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldn't help how I was feeling. We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasn't due to lack of funds. I know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted. I cant help my anger because I know we only get one proposal and one wedding. What I wanted will never happen. I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals and weddings I get upset. I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just can't control it. It's ruining our relationship because I constantly think about it. Plus, I get mad at him for small things because I am trying to hide the fact that I am so disappointed. Why can't I move on?
answer: I understand your feelings of disappointment and envy. It is normal to feel this way. Everyone has their own ideas about how a proposal or wedding should be, and it is difficult when these ideas are not met. Have you talked to your husband about how you feel? He may be able to provide some understanding and support that could help you move forward."

What is your main concern right now?", "patient": "My main concern is my daughter, I don't want her to be affected by this divorce. My emotional state ranges from numbness to anger and sadness.

answer: It sounds like you're dealing with an emotional situation at work that needs to be addressed. In order to protect yourself, it may be helpful to seek counseling and have a third-party mediator to talk through your experiences and come up with strategies for moving forward.

question: My dad refuses to acknowledge my anxieties about going to parties, dinners, etc. Whenever I have an opinion it gets shut down. My mom and everyone else behaves likewise. For my father who heads a company, this is normal. He has to be right all the time. He blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my angle. Recently however, it's been getting to the point where I feel pressured and unable to speak my mind. It isn't possible for me to get professional one-on-one help. He tells me to grow a pair and get over it. I recently have been developing more severe body image and self-confidence issues, which I have had all my life. I feel invalidated by my dad. I have been more paranoid lately as well. I can't turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident. He makes me feel guilty about it.

It might help to remember that his reaction is based on his own experiences and beliefs, which may be different from yours.

question: I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls. I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl too.

You could explore how your gender identity fits into the larger context of your life, such as how it relates to your relationships with others and what kind of career path you want to pursue."}

question: Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed. I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before. I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship. What can I do?
answer: It sounds like your cousin is projecting her own feelings of inadequacy and frustration onto you. It might help to talk through these issues together and find a way for both of you to coexist peacefully in the same space. Perhaps, exploring how each other's actions affect one another could be helpful."}

She's always telling me I'm annoying and just belittles me. Nothing I do is right. She says I work you watch the baby. On her days off she never cooks or cleans. I have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy, but says he's not any thing to her. What do I do? I don't want to leave.
answer: I understand your frustration. It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by this situation. You mentioned that before the birth of your child, she said she was raped by a family member - is there anything we can do to help her process that experience and find support? Is there anyone she could talk to about it?"}

question: Or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like The Baker Act.
answer: I understand your concern. If you think he is in immediate danger of hurting himself or others, I would advise calling 911 or the local crisis line so they can help get him the care he needs. But if you're looking for a longer-term solution, The Baker Act could be an option."}

question: In particular during family gatherings (such as funerals), where there are different customs.
answer: I understand. It can be difficult to navigate between two worlds when you’re not from here."}

question: I don't know what's wrong with me. At times I can be really happy, excited, I'll talk fast, and I want to do things. But lately I've been staying up way later and sleeping too much. I don't hang out with friends, I don't really have them. I feel nothing, worthless. I want to do nothing, I have no interest in anything. All I usually do is stay in my room. I want to be happy, I want to be nice. What's wrong with me?
answer: It sounds like you are going through a difficult time. It might help to talk to someone and get another perspective. Do you think talking to a therapist could help?"}

question: I'm worried I should see a therapist due to past events and current mental status. I'm just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone.
answer: It sounds like you are in a difficult place right now, and it is understandable that you may want to reach out for support. The first step is always the hardest - reaching out to your doctor and being open with them about what you need. From there, they will be able to advise you on the best course of action. You can also talk to a therapist about how to ask your doctor this, as well as any other concerns or questions that you may have."}

question: I'm worried I should see a therapist due to past events and current mental status. I'm just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone.
answer: It sounds like you might benefit from talking to a therapist. How can I help you take the first step in getting the help that you need?"}

question: My last relationships have ended horribly. They just up and abandoned me. One of them I have never gotten closure with over it, leaving me emotionally wrecked. I know something's wrong with me but I don't know how to even start trying to better myself. I get into these depressed like states whenever anyone I care about is too busy to be with me. I know that I shouldn't act like that because people are genuinely busy, but I feel like they're doing it just because they don't want to be around me.
answer: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and lonely. You mention feeling abandoned in your relationships, so I think it would be beneficial for you to explore why that is and how to have healthier connections with others. It might also help to find ways to manage your emotions when people are too busy to spend time with you. Talking to someone qualified to help you process through these feelings could be very helpful. Do you think you would be open to seeking therapy for this?",

question: I haven't uttered one word to my boyfriend in days. Now I'm over it and don't know how to approach the situation?
answer: Oh dear. It sounds like you are feeling very frustrated and confused. Can you tell me more about what has happened? What happened between you and your boyfriend that made you feel this way?"}

question: I've been with my boyfriend over 3 years. He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant. He is physically and mentally abusive towards me. I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues; however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything. I’m always there when he needs my help. He tells me although I help him doesn’t mean that I am a good person. He always discredits me as a woman and it’s hurtful. I spend most day crying and feeling lonely. I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do.
answer: I'm sorry to hear that you are going through such a difficult time. It sounds like he is not respecting you or treating you with the kindness and respect that you deserve. You should be proud of yourself for trying to talk things out, but it doesn't sound like it has helped. Have you considered telling him how you feel? It might help if you have a conversation about what bothers you, and try to work on solutions together."}

question: I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.
answer: I understand your concern and confusion. It is understandable that you want to be with someone who you are falling in love with, but it may be important to consider the impact this could have on your relationships with your roommates and family if their feelings about this man's past offense are not able to be overcome. Have you considered how you would explain his past to your son? It is understandable that you want to forgive him, but it may be important to consider the impact of any decisions you make regarding this relationship before taking any further steps."}

question: About 3 years ago or so I was skinny, but I was still ugly. I really do want to change that but I've tried 3 times. Now can I try but don't stop. At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them. How can I stop thinking about them and don't let it get in my head? My parents said I don't weight that much but, they do think I am fat but, they tell me I am not. I told my parents that I need to go to a therapist, but they think I am fine and I think they don't want to deal with it.
answer: It sounds like you have been going through a really tough time. It is understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. What would help you the most right now? Would talking to someone about how you feel be helpful? You could also try practicing self-care activities like yoga or journaling, if you'd like."}

question: A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.
answer: It sounds like you have had an emotional journey these past few nights, and it is understandable that you would be feeling overwhelmed and helpless. It seems that this girl has been very supportive of you and made you feel better about yourself. That is a great thing! However, it may not be possible for you to maintain the relationship given your current distance. Is there something else you can do to make sure these feelings stay with you? Maybe find other ways to connect with her or find other sources of support?",

question: We make love once per month. Is it normal?
answer: It is normal for some couples, but not all. How often do you have sex?"}

question: In this argument my friends are all against me so I'm wondering if I'm exaggerating my feelings. I feel like I'm being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim, when in reality I'm the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends. Or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship?
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Can you tell me more about what is happening so that we can look at the situation from a different perspective?"}

question: I am always down and out. Could this be postpartum depression?
answer: It is possible that you may be experiencing postpartum depression. It is important to seek medical advice and talk to a therapist if you are feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts or emotions. I'm here for you if you want to talk more about how you're feeling."}

question: I am married to a beautiful lady. I love my wife with all my heart. We have 3 boys and I have a daughter from a previous marriage. We also have 3 grandchildren. Now this event is tearing us apart. I want our family to be together and happy. It was a mistake from so long ago. My wife wants to leave and I don't want that to happen I love her so much. Please help me save my marriage. Even my 3 boys want us to work it out. They love us both and want our family together. Please give me some advice or hope. Sincerely heart broken.
answer: I understand your pain, but it is important that you both talk through the issue at hand. Try to find a common ground between your wife's feelings and your own.

question: My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.
answer: It sounds like you both need to have a serious conversation about your expectations for the relationship, and also how to make sure that intimacy and trust are maintained. It's great that she made an effort to initiate sex tonight - this could be a great opportunity to talk about what works best for both of you in terms of creating a romantic environment."}

question: I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?
answer: I think you are doing a great job at pushing through adversity, and it’s natural to become overwhelmed when feeling like our efforts are not enough. Is there anyone in your life you could talk to about how you feel? Sometimes just getting things out into the open helps to make a situation seem more manageable."}

question: He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple.

Do you think it might help to talk through these things together?", "patient": "Yes, I do think it would help. Thank you for your advice."}

question: I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call. I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?
answer: I understand why you are feeling this way, and I think that it is important for you to figure out what it is that you want from a relationship. You need to have a clear idea of the type of person that you would like to be with so that you can make sure that your choices are based on those criteria and not just impulsive decisions. It might help if you list all the qualities that you desire in a partner, so that when an opportunity arises, you will be able to make a more informed decision about whether or not it is something worth pursuing. Above all else, I want you to remember that you deserve to feel safe and secure, and that you do not need to settle for anything less than what makes you happy."}

question: I regret ever hurting her and they mean the world to me. But it feels like nothing I do seem to work. I'll always love them no matter what and when I'm with them nothing else matters. I love them more then anything. I don't want another guy raising my kids.
answer: It sounds like you have a lot of love for your family. It can be difficult to know how to show that love in the way that is most beneficial and meaningful for them. Is there anything specific that you are looking for advice on, or just generally exploring different ways of showing your love?"}

question: I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?
answer: It sounds like you are facing an emotional challenge that requires attention. It is important for you to be honest with yourself about your feelings, so that you can better understand their origins and why they have become such a priority in your life. Once you recognize the underlying cause of this imbalance, then it will be easier to re-prioritize and make adjustments to create a healthier balance between all three of your relationships. Talking with those close to you can help provide perspective and guide you through any decisions that need to be made."}

question: I find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about. How do I figure out what triggers me to do this? And how do I help overcome this problem? I would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by the need to lie. It might be helpful to look into the reasons why you feel that lying is necessary in the first place. It could also be helpful to explore other ways of dealing with stressors and anxieties without turning to dishonesty. It might help to talk about your feelings and get a better understanding of how you can address the triggers that lead to lying. This could include developing healthier coping mechanisms, identifying and reaching out for support, or exploring other resources that can help you navigate through difficult times."}

question: I've been like this ever since I was in school; back then I transferred to another school. Now I'm thinking about changing my job.
answer: Oh, that sounds difficult. What happened at the previous school?", "patient": "The other kids weren't very welcoming and I didn't feel accepted. That made me really nervous, so I decided to transfer."}

question: We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls. It went on for about 8 months. Just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room. Once I met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop. We ended up kissing after lunch and then I sent him a few more texts that day telling him I was serious and that was the end of it. His wife (my good friend) saw us kiss once and told my husband. I told him a couple of things then and we got over it. A year later she told him a couple of other things. Same story. It's been about 3 years since. They are now divorced and my husband and I have been happy. A few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her now ex told her more stuff we did. I decided to just tell my husband everything. We are trying to work things out. But he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it. How can I help him believe me?
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for both of you. It might help your husband to hear directly from you about what happened, and also to know the context in which these events occurred. It could help him process your story and come to a place of understanding and trust. Is there anything else that he needs to process this?"}

question: Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family. However, now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children to get hurt. I'm not sure how to move forward?
answer: I understand your dilemma. Have you been able to talk to your partner about what happened and how you feel? If so, what was his reaction? How is he willing to make amends and regain trust in the relationship?"}

question: I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.
answer: It sounds like you need some space to consider what you want. It might be helpful to get some individual therapy to process these strong feelings of anxiety, depression, and panic. You could also try couples counseling with him to better communicate your needs and desires in the relationship. This will help create a healthier environment for both of you to decide what you want long-term."}

question: What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because no one would want me. Or I couldn't have many friends because of who I am. It's strange I want to be loved but I'd hate to be because I always lose.

question: I'm in a relationship, but I feel like I'm always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated. My ex told me that I will never find anyone else, and that's lingering in the back of my mind.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed with this relationship. How do you feel when you think about breaking up with your partner?",

question: This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family to help me. I have no money for therapy, but I think I need therapy before I can secure a job.
answer: That sounds like an incredibly difficult situation you are in. I understand how being around your mother could be overwhelming and stressful for you. Is there anything that you would like to talk about regarding this? How has your relationship with her evolved over the years, and what impact has it had on your life? Do you feel comfortable talking about how she affects you emotionally?"}

question: I have no self control over food. Most people stop when they've had enough, but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets - I'm never done eating dessert.

question: I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating. What advice might you offer?
answer: It sounds like your partner may be overwhelmed by stress and negativity. It's important to be mindful of how you communicate, as even the smallest things can have an effect on one another. One way to ensure that both parties feel heard and respected is to use active listening. This involves making eye contact, nodding your head and using phrases such as \"I understand\" or \"please continue\". Additionally, it may be helpful to take breaks from conversations when they become too heated. Taking a few moments to breathe deeply and collect your thoughts can help both parties find a more productive way of communicating. Finally, it might also be beneficial to practice self-care. This can involve anything from meditation to exercise which can help both partners stay calm, collected and open to communication."}

question: When I ask him who he is talking to, he tells me no one. But, it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone. I have even accused him of having a secret cell phone. I ask so much, I feel like I am losing it. Is he trying to make me question my sanity, or is he talking to himself?
answer: I understand that this must be very confusing and worrying for you. It is important to remember that everyone is unique and has their own way of dealing with things. Maybe your loved one is just talking out loud to himself as a way of sorting through thoughts and ideas."}

question: Does this go against any ethical codes? Are there legal ramifications?
answer: No, it does not go against any ethical codes, nor are there any legal ramifications. However, I advise you to be mindful of what you share as it could be emotionally taxing."}

question: We went out had great sex and I was really liking her. Then one day she says we should just be friends, but I can't stop thinking about her. She's always on mind and I want her back.
answer: It sounds like you still have strong feelings for this person. It can be difficult to let go of those feelings and move on, especially if the other person is not interested in continuing the relationship. Have you talked to her about how you feel? There's a chance that she may still have some feeling for you, even if she doesn't want to continue the relationship."}

question: She cried because she lost all trust in me. Now I feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed, what do I do?
answer: I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be very difficult for you. Could you tell me more about how you feel?"}

question: I'm a 40 year old male and having erection problems. Still have the desire for a woman. Awfully frustrated. Any suggestions? My Doc doesn't want to discuss it.

question: He is in his late thirties and I am in my mid twenties. We have been together for about 5 months. I really like him. He says he cares about me and is willing to fight to make things right. He has been very apologetic and expressed he did it out of fear. I don't know if it's worth giving him a second chance.
answer: It sounds like you have been through a lot together and have come to the conclusion that he was simply trying to protect himself from an unknown fear. This is very difficult and it is understandable why you may be feeling confused and uncertain about his intentions. I suggest that before giving him another chance, you both take some time to process what has happened and discuss how you can both move forward in a healthier way."}

question: However, it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself. I have even accused him of having a secret phone. Is he trying to make me crazy on purpose, or is he really talking to himself?
answer: I understand your concern. Can you tell me more about how this appears to be happening?"}

question: I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.
answer: You seem to have a pattern of taking on the burden of others and expecting them to change without your helping yourself. This is not sustainable and will lead to more disappointments. You need to also focus on changing yourself, learning what you can and cannot do for others and when it's time to seek help from professionals."}

question: My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.

answer: I'm so sorry you had to experience that. It sounds like a very difficult situation to be in. How did the separation come about? Was it something that you decided together or was it forced upon him? Were there any other factors involved such as financial struggles or family interference?"}

question: I'm in a relationship with my fiancé and I currently found out that she's been cheating on me with a co-worker. I was very upset none the less. I understand what she did was wrong, but I want to spend the rest of my life with her. So I'm willing to forgive and move on. We have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son. At the beginning of our relationship, I was unfaithful and she caught me cheating. She forgave me for what I've done to her and since then I been completely faithful. I'm worried about our relationship and want to move forward but its been very unsettling. All I can think about is her with another man. I don't know what to do or where to go for advice?

question: I'm in a relationship with my fiancé and I currently found out that she's been cheating on me with a co-worker. I was very upset none the less. I understand what she did was wrong, but I want to spend the rest of my life with her. So I'm willing to forgive and move on. We have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son. At the beginning of our relationship, I was unfaithful and she caught me cheating. She forgave me for what I've done to her and since then I been completely faithful.

question: About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why. For me it seemed out of the blue. I don't miss her as much as I used to but I just don't trust people anymore, not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family. I'm so terrified of being judged or dismissed. Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, I've just shut down. I haven't felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart. I'm scared to because I don't want it to be taken away from me again. I feel like ever lesson I learn only last a day. I just don't know what to do. I'm working at a place I know I should enjoy. I'm keeping up with my creative passions: working out, eating healthy, etc. I'm doing everything the books say I should do, but I don't feel any different. I just don't know what to do.
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It can be very difficult to trust people after going through something painful like this. Have you tried reaching out to your friends and family to let them know what you’re going through? It might help to talk about it and have their support. As far as feeling comfortable and happy with yourself, I would recommend exploring ways to practice self-care. Make sure you are eating nutritious meals, getting enough sleep, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. Taking the time for yourself is important too, so try setting aside some time each day to do something that brings you peace and relaxation. I'm here if you need anyone to talk to.

I'm worried about our relationship and want to move forward but its been very unsettling. All I can think about is her with another man. I don't know what to do or where to go for advice?
answer: I understand how difficult it must be for you. It sounds like you have already forgiven your partner and want to move forward, but the thought of them being intimate with another person is still very distressing. Have you two discussed what happened and what each other's intentions are? Open communication is key in any relationship, so I would recommend that if you are both willing to try and make it work, then this should be the first step towards rebuilding trust and understanding one another."}

question: I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that I'm okay when I'm not. I'm always blocking out the bad things and forgetting. I also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will. I feel truly alone.

You deserve to be cared for and accepted, and it is understandable if you feel lonely when this doesn't happen. It may help to talk more about what you need and why you need it, so that you can get the support you deserve."}

question: This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family to help me.

answer: I understand that you are concerned about your boyfriend taking medication for depression. It is important that you both communicate openly, so that you can support each other during this difficult time. You may want to talk together about how he's feeling and what he needs right now. Remember that you are not responsible for his feelings or thoughts - only he can know what those are. Do you want to talk more about how to best approach this situation?"}

answer: It sounds like you are struggling with feeling lonely and disconnected even though you may be trying to block out negative thoughts.

answer: I understand how difficult it is to trust people after going through such a painful experience. It might help you to remember that everyone is unique and has their own story and experiences. You could try reaching out to your friends and family, and letting them know what you're feeling. That way they can support you and remind you of the good things in your life. As for trusting yourself, I suggest taking baby steps. Try to focus on one thing at a time, like working on a project or going for a walk. You could also try journaling about how you feel and what is important to you. Taking things slowly can help you find the strength to move forward with hope and courage."}

question: Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.
answer: It sounds like you are dealing with some very powerful emotions. It is understandable that these thoughts would be overwhelming for you. Is there something specific about life after death that is causing you to feel this way?"}

answer: It sounds like you have gone through a lot in your life, and are now struggling with how to cope with this situation. It is understandable that you may feel scared of being a single parent.

This could help you understand why you have the reactions you do to the situation, and also give you tools on how to best cope with it all."}

question: She was raised by her abusive father and his wife. 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana. I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years. When I was released, she was 5 and didn't remember me. Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit, having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana. She doesn't remember that. I do. Over the years, I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship. She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year. I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption. Last night, I was angry at the world and afraid of God. I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running. Now I'm not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now. Help.
answer: I understand your anger and fear. It sounds like you have had a difficult life experience, but it is good that you are able to reflect on it and recognize the impact it has had on your relationships with others. Is there anything I can do to help you process these emotions?"}

I understand what she did was wrong, but I want to spend the rest of my life with her. So I'm willing to forgive and move on. We have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son. At the beginning of our relationship, I was unfaithful and she caught me cheating. She forgave me for what I've done to her and since then I been completely faithful. I'm worried about our relationship and want to move forward but its been very unsettling. All I can think about is her with another man. I don't know what to do or where to go for advice?
answer: I understand how difficult this situation must be for you. Forgiveness is always an option, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the trust between you and your partner can be fully restored. Have you two talked about how to move forward from here?"}

question: Why am I attracted to older men?
answer: I think it's important to take a look at why you are feeling attracted to older men. Is there something about the way they carry themselves that is appealing to you?"}

question: I found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.
answer: It sounds like you are concerned about your boyfriend and the changes you have seen in him recently. It is understandable that this has caused you some worry and anxiety. Maybe it would be helpful to talk more about how you both feel and what has happened between you two recently?"}

question: I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and confused by this situation. It is understandable that you would be hurt and confused, given the way your best friend has been acting. What do you think caused her to reach out to this other person? Are there any patterns or themes in the conversations that you two have had recently? Does she seem more distant than usual? How can you both reconnect?"}

question: Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me. This rollercoaster is crazy.
answer: It can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to feel that way. I'm here if you want to talk about it."}

question: I'm going through a majorly bad divorce and my wife is making things so impossible for me. I need help.
answer: It sounds like you are in a very difficult situation. Is there anything I can do to help? How do you think your wife is making things hard for you?"}

question: I want us all to get along, but feel that I am not being respected. Of course I do have some insecurities because he was with his ex for 8 years. He wants to see his step daughter and ex makes it so he has to go there to see her, but she doesn't want me around. She has a boyfriend, but mine fixes their vehicles, goes over once a week and hangs out with the ex and does family things with her. Since he works nights, I only see him parts of Friday-Sunday and we live together. He won't let me use his phone when I forgot mine, says his ex used to mess with it. I don't think he's cheating, but he will lie about what time he actually left her place to come home or about going over early to be with them. I feel like the other woman. She has tried to mess with holiday plans by restricting when he can see the child. He only dated once person before her, so this could be why. I don't feel he has let go enough. He is a wonderful boyfriend other than this.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling very frustrated and disrespected. You also mentioned that he was with his ex for 8 years, which may be contributing to the difficulty of him letting go fully. Is there anything you would like your boyfriend to do differently?", "patient": "Yes! He needs to let me use his phone when I forget mine and stop lying about it. He also needs to understand that if we have plans I should be able to see them through without issue. If he's going over early or staying late, then he needs to tell me so I don't worry. We had a miscommunication where he thought I was mad when I wasn't and it caused an argument. He can't just decide to go hang out with her family without telling me in advance."}

question: My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again. I don't know what to do.
answer: It sounds like you have a lot of trust and faith in this therapist. It might be helpful for you to take some time to reflect on why you chose to loan him money and why you trusted him with your credit card information. Does it feel right to you that he didn't come back when you needed him? How can I support you in making decisions about this situation?"}

question: I found messages between my boyfriend and this girl on social media. He was asking her for naked pictures and then hung out with her once, but nothing happened. I didn’t find out about the messages until last month and that was six months after it happened. I can’t trust him anymore and I'm just wondering if I ever will. He admitted that he wanted to have sex with her but he didn't. He was only talking with her because he thought we were going to have a break up. My heart is completely broken. I feel like I'm in competition with every girl on the planet for my boyfriend’s affection. I'm afraid that he doesn't like me anymore, but without me he's homeless and without a car. I love him so much. It's been tearing me apart. I don't feel pretty anymore though. I don't feel good enough for anyone or anything. I thought I knew him as well as I knew myself. Then all of a sudden my world was flipped upside down. I'm still trying to figure out which way is up.
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you, and that your trust has been broken. It may help to process what happened, and why he felt the need to reach out to this other girl in the first place. It could also help to talk about how you two can move forward, if at all possible. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?"}

question: In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?
answer: It is understandable that you are struggling with this situation. It can be difficult to know what path to take when relationships are complicated by infidelity. If your former husband is willing to commit to stopping all contact with other women, then there is potential for healing and reconciliation in the marriage. However, if he is not ready or willing to make this commitment, then it may be best to part ways. It is ultimately up to him how he wants to proceed." }

question: I was married to a narcissist sociopath for 10 years. During that time I was a general manager. I used to help him financially and in other ways when we were together. But things began to change. He emotionally and sexually drained me. I lost my spirit. I used to be a very happy person but now I am a loner. I left him and moved to another state. Currently, I'm working as a server which makes me believe less in myself. I feel pity for myself a lot but don't know what to do. When I have money problems, he does not help me. He actually enjoys seeing me have a hard time in my life. I need help.
answer: I understand it must be very difficult for you. It sounds like your ex-partner was very emotionally and sexually manipulative. This can take its toll on a person's self-confidence, spirit and sense of worthiness. Is there anything that I or anyone else can do to help you find the strength within yourself again? I would be happy to provide support or resources if you are open to receiving them." }

question: I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes. I have problems with anger management. Apparently, I also have an ODD, bipolar and split personality. How can I be truly happy?
answer: It sounds like you are dealing with a lot of complex issues that have been hard to manage. It is understandable why you would want to find true happiness. Firstly, it may help to get more information on your diagnoses and how best to manage them. Additionally, looking for ways to bring more balance, self-care, and relaxation into your life can be helpful. Finally, speaking to a therapist who specialises in these issues could be really beneficial."}

question: My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again. I don't know what to do.
answer: That is a difficult situation for you to be in. It sounds like you have been in an exploitative relationship with this therapist, where he took advantage of your trust and friendship to gain access to your finances. This is not acceptable behavior, and I can understand why it would feel overwhelming. Please reach out to a hotline or support group for survivors of abuse and exploitation, as well as a lawyer specializing in these types of cases. It may be helpful to talk with other people who have experienced similar situations, so you do not feel alone in this journey."}

question: My boyfriend says I'm nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help. When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I can't help but think that something is wrong. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I try to talk with him to make it better. I let him know when I am feeling down. But I am not confident in these things. Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him. He texted her back with "Sorry, I've been working. I just read your message." The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me. He texted her back with "Don't text me anymore." I don't feel like I am way out of the line. But I can't talk with him if all that he will say is that I'm crazy and I need help. What should I do? How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me?
answer: I understand how difficult it must be for you to deal with these feelings. It is important to take steps towards getting the help you need so that you can find clarity and peace of mind. You could try talking to a friend or loved one, or even a counselor to explore your thoughts and feelings further. Sometimes just getting things out in the open helps to make sense of them and provide new perspectives. Doing this can also help you decide what steps to take next. I'm here if you need any more support."}

question: I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home. They are peeing in cat litter boxes, bottles, and directly on floors and in corners of my house. Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way? This is not a joke. I am trying to understand.
answer: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it must be very frustrating. Do you know who the extended family members are? Have they said anything about why they're behaving this way?"}

question: Tonight, my husband seemed to put our son down through an incorrect approach. His approach was perfectly wrong. I found myself defending my son. I told him that what he did was not the way to encourage our son. Instead of watching my husband’s harsh behavior I decided to sit beside my son and, together, we worked on his science assignment in order to encourage him to study. My husband got upset and he was swearing at me. He threatened me. I knew that he was not joking. His words scared me a lot!
answer: I am so sorry to hear this. It is understandable how you would be feeling overwhelmed, anxious and afraid right now. Can you tell me more about what happened? What did your husband say next?"}

question: How do I ever trust another woman? I have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that I meet. I am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions. Once the "relationship" was over, she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application.
answer: It sounds like you have had a really difficult experience with this woman. It is understandable that you may be hesitant to trust another woman. How can I help you process your feelings and thoughts around this experience?"}

question: I am currently living in a hotel and I don’t have a family. I met a guy a month ago. He is a bisexual. He has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites. He would not help pay for the room. When I asked for the TV remote control, he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it. I slapped him and asked him to leave my room. We recently just got back together. One time I was sick. He came to visit and feed me but left no money. Then he texts me and brags about his house and car knowing that I have struggles living at a hotel. He says that he has a whole house where he can put me in and orders me to text him whenever I need someone to have sex with. He left his bath soap so he could come and get it. I think that he is trying to find a way to come back. Please help me. What’s going on? I am a good, loyal woman. Why is he treating me like this?
answer: I understand your frustration with this situation. It sounds like you are being taken advantage of and it's not fair. It may be helpful to talk about why he might be acting this way and what you can do to set boundaries in the relationship. Is there anything specific that you would like to change?",

question: I’m a senior high school student. I’m also five months pregnant. I got pregnant by my boyfriend of three years. My parents don’t want us to communicate with each other. He can’t even come to visit my gynecologist. My mom goes to attend all of my doctor’s appointments. She’s supportive of me. I wish, though, that my boyfriend was next to me and be able to see his daughter on a sonogram, at the very least. My family does not understand that he deserves that much. I cry all the time because I feel lost and hopeless. I need guidance and I believe that you can give it to me. Am I wrong for wanting him around? Are they right for keeping him away from the appointments and not letting us communicate with each other even though we are the parents? I do everything that they ask of me. I just want him to be around. When I ask my parents to let him be here, they call me a selfish person. Please help me.
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. Your parents' wishes can be hard to accept and it is normal to feel lost and hopeless in times like these. It might help to talk to your boyfriend about what bothers your parents, so they don't feel excluded from the process. Also, if he truly cares for you and your baby, he should want to be part of this journey together with you. Please remember that you are not alone in this, and I am here for you if you need somebody to talk to."}

question: I have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now. This issue has persisted for 10 years already but I don't know where to start. I do not have the soundest information either.
answer: It is understandable that you might feel overwhelmed and confused. It is important to remember that you can take baby steps towards your goal. Have you thought about how you would like to proceed? What has been holding you back from taking action?",

question: How do I stop those thoughts?
answer: It's difficult to stop these thoughts completely, but there are strategies you can use to manage them. One is to practice mindfulness and be present in the moment. Another is to challenge the negative thoughts with positive affirmations. It might also help to talk about your thoughts and feelings with a trusted friend or therapist."}

question: I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls. I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl too. I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything. I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl.
answer: It sounds like you are really struggling with your gender identity. Is there anything else that you want to share?",

question: I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents. I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.
answer: I understand how difficult it is to open up to your parents about personal matters. It is important that you feel safe and supported in sharing your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with them. In order for this to happen, your parents will need to learn more about who you are and what is important to you. It might help if they learn more about the LGBTQ+ community, as well as the struggles you experience with depression and anxiety. As for trust, it is essential that both sides build a strong foundation of understanding and respect. You can start by being open with your parents about who you are, what worries you and why. This way, they will learn to trust in your ability to take responsibility for yourself. I suggest that you set up an appointment together so we can begin this journey as a family."}

question: I'm going through a divorce with my wife of three years, who I've known since the 4th grade and been involved with for seven years! We just had a baby seven months ago and never got along with my mother, who I've lived with for years. I am now back with my mother because I have nowhere to go with this divorce looming. I'm heart broken because I fell into a depression, I haven't seen my child in a while, I'm having good and bad dreams, and I feel hated. Can you help? Can you intervene? Can I speak with someone?
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like it has been a long road of heartbreak and sadness. It is important to take care of yourself during this time, and reach out if you need additional help or support. I am here for you if you want to talk more about how you are feeling and any thoughts or worries that come up in the meantime."}

question: I been having anger problems a lot lately. It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off. I use to not be like this until I got with my soon-to-be husband. I think his mood and rage/anger problems have rubbed off on me a lot. I don't get nearly as bad as he does, but I yell almost constantly and I can't seem to just stop. I have two young babies that have to hear this, and I don't want my girls growing up with a mommy like I have been lately. I just don't know how to get back to my old self.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by the changes in your life. It is natural to feel angry and frustrated when things don’t go as planned. You need to find healthier ways of dealing with your emotions. Could you tell me more about how you handle stress during difficult times?"}

question: I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. I’m not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesn’t keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to. I feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I don’t know why he is acting this way lately. I believe I have separation anxiety. Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?
answer: I understand how difficult it must be for you, especially since you love him so much. It might help to talk about why he might be acting this way and what changes you could make in the relationship. Could you tell me more about your relationship?"}

question: I'm a teenager. I get random spurts of anger, like complete, pure rage. I figured it was hormones, but others notice it too. I get self-destructive. I used to cut but stopped. Now when I get mad, I bite my arms and fingers, pull my hair, scratch my face, or punch my thighs. Basically, I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom. I don't live in a bad household. I have a great family, a great relationship with my boyfriend, and a good job. I have no idea what this is and I don't know how to control it. It's over any little thing. Tonight, it was because I couldn't get my earrings out. This happens maybe two to three times on a good week, and it's always over stupid, petty things.
answer: It sounds like you are really frustrated with yourself for being able to 'hide' your anger instead of directing it at something or someone else. Do you think there is anything that might help you to better process these feelings? Anger is a natural emotion and it can be healthy and productive if channeled in positive ways."}

question: He said he would try and he never did. It's been nine months, and this is making me worse. Today, he said I have to respect whatever decision he makes. Is that true? Am I supposed to respect the decision to leave because he can't handle what I'm going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? He's constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.
answer: I understand this is difficult for you. It sounds like you are looking for some reassurance that your partner cares about working things out, but it also seems like there is a lack of trust between the two of you. Could we talk more about what happened today and how you feel in this moment? What do you need from him to feel safe and supported?"}

question: My new daughter-in-law just informed me that she is smoking marijuana while pregnant because of her morning sickness. I’m in shock and I don’t know how to respond. I just lost my mom, and she was good with advice.
answer: I understand this is a difficult time for you. How are you feeling about your new daughter-in-law's decision?", "patient": "I feel horrified - like she isn’t taking the health of her baby seriously. What do you think I should do or say?"}

question: He said he would try and he never did. It's been nine months, and this is making me worse. Today, he said I have to respect whatever decision he makes. Is that true? Am I supposed to respect the decision to leave because he can't handle what I'm going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? He's constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.
answer: It sounds like you feel very uncertain and frustrated. What do you think would help you the most right now?"}

question: I've been hospitalized twice. Once was last month for psychiatric help. I'm on medicine, but I'm struggling with fighting the negative thoughts, irrational fears, and loneliness. The people around me aren't helping much.
answer: It sounds like you are going through a difficult time. It is understandable that you feel overwhelmed and scared. Is there anything I can do to help? I am here for you."}

question: I find myself being very outgoing most of the time, but there are some times when I don't know what to say. I don't even want to talk at all. It's like, I search for the right thing to say and nothing ever comes out. I don't know if I'm outgoing only to fill the void of not knowing what to say. I don’t know if people like that about me. I'm very self-conscious and always think people are talking about me, so it makes me have a cold shoulder and not want to talk.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by this experience. It is okay to feel uncomfortable or scared sometimes. What can help you in these moments is being mindful of your breathing and focusing on what it is that you need right now. Sometimes just taking a few moments for yourself can help you relax, breathe, and find the words that want to come out."}

question: I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.
answer: It sounds like you are in a very difficult place right now. Is there anything that I can do to help?"}

question: I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that I’m an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety.
answer: That must have been very difficult to go through, and it's understandable why you would still be affected by it as an adult. Is there anything that you need help with, or just someone to talk to?"}

question: My toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training. He almost throws up every time he sees his poop. He gags and will not go on the toilet. We have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the big-boy toilet, but he refuses to use it. When he sits on the toilet, he just sits there forever and only will pee. He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper. I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him. How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress?
answer: I understand this must be a difficult time for you and your son. It sounds like he may have some anxiety around going to the bathroom, which can be very common in young children. Have you tried using positive reinforcement to encourage him when he does use the toilet? This could involve praise, rewards or treats as a way of rewarding him for using the potty. You may also want to consider taking him to see a behavioral specialist who can help you find ways to best support your son and help him through this phase."}

question: I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that I’m an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety.
answer: I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be very difficult for you. What are some of the ways your anxiety manifests?",

question: I was raped by multiple men, and now I can't stand the sight of myself. I wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife.
answer: It sounds like you are in a really difficult situation. Is there anything that you would like to talk about?"}

question: My husband and I would've been married for five years come June 2016. Our infant daughter just had her birthday. Shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. He has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. The children do not have a good relationship with him now. He has another child from a woman he was dating. He decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant. It seems to me that there is a pattern. He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. I've tried to research online, but I'm not getting any answers. He also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder. He also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals. Is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have? Where do you recommend researching this?
answer: I understand your confusion, it sounds like you are trying to make sense of an incredibly difficult situation. It is possible that your husband may be suffering from a mental health issue such as depression or bipolar disorder, however I am not qualified to diagnose anyone and so I cannot say for sure. To better understand what your husband is going through, it might be helpful to speak to a qualified mental health professional who can give you more insight into his behavior. In the meantime, there are some great resources available online that you could look at to help you gain more clarity."}

question: I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that I’m an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety.
answer: That must have been very traumatic for you. It's understandable that you would be affected by it in your adult life. Have you talked to a professional about how you are feeling?"}

question: I don’t love my sister. I would never wish her harm, but if I could, I would wish for us not to be related. Is this cruel? Why must blood mean we have to be friends? Am I being unreasonable and is there a way to fix this? I do care about her, like I do every human being, but I’d rather be with my friends than be with her at all. It’s not just a "teenager phase." I still love my mom and dad, and I’m very close to them. However, it’s my sister I don’t love or have ever really liked at all.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling a lot of complicated emotions towards your sister that run deeper than just simple liking or disliking. It is understandable if you do not want to be close with her, and it could be helpful to talk about why you feel this way and what might be some possible ways to handle this situation. Do you think there’s something you can do to make things better?"}

question: Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven. When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety. Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.
answer: It sounds like you have some strong feelings about life after death, and it is understandable that this could cause you distress. Maybe we can explore why you feel this way, and try to come up with some strategies to help manage the thoughts and emotions that accompany them." #MentalHealthAwareness

question: My boyfriend’s sneaky and puts his friends before me. He fights just to leave. One day, he's happy. The next, he's mean and blames me for everything. He can't admit faults. He thinks he's perfect and does no wrong.

question: My ex-boyfriend, will not stop harassing and stalking me. We work together. I honestly think he needs help to move on. His accusations are angry lies. But I think he may believe them to be true.
answer: I understand this must be very difficult for you. It sounds like your ex-boyfriend is having a hard time letting go and it might be helpful if someone could talk to him about his feelings. What do you think would help?"}

question: My ex-boyfriend and I met over a year ago. We hit it off and fell in love pretty quick. However, he has trust issues and assumed I was cheating. When I found out I was pregnant, we had just broken up. Five months later, I lost the baby, and we did not speak for a few weeks. Now we are talking, and he says he loves me but is afraid I will hurt him "again." I just want to know where to go with this because I love him so much, and I want to get back to us being happy and a family.
answer: It sounds like you have gone through a lot together. It's understandable that your ex-boyfriend has trust issues - it takes time to heal from such a traumatic experience. I suggest setting clear boundaries, both of you expressing respect for each other and commitment to rebuilding trust in the relationship. Acknowledge his fear and show him you are willing to take steps towards getting back together while also respecting his needs for security and safety." }

answer: It sounds like you both have had a difficult time lately. It's understandable that he has trust issues, but it also sounds like he still cares for you deeply. Is there anything you can do to help him process his feelings of insecurity? You could try to talk openly and gently about how he is feeling and reassure him that you are committed to making the relationship work. The two of you might benefit from speaking with a counselor together, as well."}

question: She treats me like I'm not in her presence. She’s always yelling at me for no reason. She gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while I respect her.
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like there are a lot of conflicting emotions inside of you. Is there anything I can do to help?"}

answer: I am so sorry to hear that you are going through such a difficult period. It must be very painful for you. Could you tell me more about how it happened?"}

answer: It sounds like you are struggling with feelings of loneliness and isolation. It is normal to want to block out negative emotions, but it can be helpful to process these emotions with someone who cares about you. Do you have any trusted friends or family that you could confide in?",

question: I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him. The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. In my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like it has been very challenging dealing with these two individuals. You mentioned that your ex threatened to not let you have access to your stepdaughter if you don’t discuss her matters with him - this is unacceptable and not in the child's best interest. I would recommend to stay firm and consistent, as well as reach out for help from a trusted adult if needed. Please know that you are not alone in this, and there are resources available to support you through this process." }, { "author": "Renee", "date": "2019-05-28T17:16:34+00:00", "content": "I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. It is unfortunate that you have been put in this position, especially since it affects the children. It sounds like a difficult predicament and I understand how overwhelming this could be for you.

question: Every time I speak, he says I anger him. Also, when he’s mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me. I feel like we’re so distant from each other now. We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in. What should I do? We've been married for two years but together for seven.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated and disconnected from your husband. It might be helpful to have a conversation with him about what is causing the negative feelings, and how both of you can work on rebuilding the connection between you. By understanding his triggers and being able to communicate more effectively, you can create a stronger foundation and resolve any issues before they arise." }

answer: It sounds like a difficult situation for you and your family. I think it is important for both of your children to learn healthy ways of resolving conflicts. Can we brainstorm some strategies together that might help in this process?"}

question: I use to be so happy. No matter what, I always was happy. I got into a relationship with this guy. I love him so much. We’re both teenagers. The week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him. It broke me. He came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other. He comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that I have to lie to her.
answer: I understand it is difficult to be separated from your partner. Is there anything else going on in your life that might be contributing to the stress?",

question: My husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person. Before, he worked and slept, and on off days, he'd stay home because he didn't want to do anything else. Now he's going out with friends several nights a week while I'm still home working a 50 hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself. He's suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife, but the whole time, I'm remembering how I've been emotionally starving for the last five years.
answer: I understand this must be difficult for you. Can you tell me more about how it has affected your relationship with your husband?", "patient": "He ignores my texts and emails, doesn't have time to talk when I call him, and is distant in person. He says he loves me but it's hard to believe him. We used to connect on a deeper level, but it feels like that part of our relationship has gone away with him being so busy all the time. Whenever I bring this up, he gets angry or shuts down and won't talk about it anymore."}

question: My long-distance girlfriend is in a sorority, and it's changing her. I feel like I'm becoming less important to her and it hurts. She just wants me to support the sorority, but it's so hard. I try every day to show her she's the most important thing to me, but she can't even stay relatively sober at a fraternity party for me so that I won't worry about her doing anything regretful. We love each other, but we're in a rough patch.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling very frustrated and concerned. It is understandable to want to protect the person you love, however it also seems as though your girlfriend may be wanting to assert her independence within the sorority. Perhaps you could find ways to support each other in this change while still showing your own care and concern? Is there anything else that is causing you stress or anxiety that I can help with?"}

question: My husband always works. He does work from home, but his hours are from morning until night, and he neglects his family. If I have anything I want to do, I have to find a babysitter, but he does what he wants. He rarely comes to bed when I do, and we never have date nights.
answer: I understand it can be difficult being the only caregiver for your family. It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Is there anyone else who can help you with taking care of your children? Do you have any hobbies or interests that you would like to pursue?",

question: Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.

question: I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the "perfect guy"? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?
answer: I understand that you are in a long distance relationship and feeling attracted to other men than your partner. It is natural to feel this way since it is human nature to be attracted to people we find physically attractive. In terms of what to do next, I would suggest that you evaluate the relationship from all angles and make sure it is healthy and happy for both of you. When relationships are based on mutual understanding and respect, then it can work out even if physical attraction wanes over time. If things are not as equal in your relationship, then you may want to re-evaluate and decide what is best for the both of you.",

question: I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.

question: Back in high school, my friend and I used to masturbate around each other. I hate even talking about it now because it's so weird. We didn't even realize how messed up it was at the time. One time, it escalated and we ended up doing it for each other. It wasn't supposed to be a gay thing, but it sure sounds like it now that I talk about it. I pushed this away until it recently came up in my head again. I'm having a lot of trouble.
answer: Wow, that is very odd and quite a confusing experience for you. It doesn't sound like there was any thought or understanding of the consequences at the time either. Do you feel like anything else happened around this same time?",

question: Everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it. Everyone around me is skinny, and here I am trying to throw up so I'm not fat. Everything I do is wrong, and I can't seem to do anything right! No one else at school seems to feel the way I do! Is this normal teenage girls feelings? I don't think these feelings are normal.
answer: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. It is normal for teenagers to have a range of emotions, but it can be helpful to talk to someone about how you're feeling. Do you want to talk more about what you're experiencing?"}

I think it would be beneficial for you to explore your feelings further, especially if this relationship is something you want to continue pursuing. In order to do so, it may help to talk to someone who can listen and provide guidance in understanding yourself better."},

question: I am an international student, and it is my first semester in graduate school in the United States. I faced a cultural shock, and I was so depressed when I arrived here. My counselor in the university was my savior. He helped me a great deal. Now I am going back to my country for a vacation. I was thinking to get him something special with my country's name on it, and I remembered that he likes wine. My country is known for that. Is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after Christmas?
answer: Yes, it is perfectly appropriate to give your counselor a bottle of wine as a thoughtful gesture. If you wish, you can have it personalized with your country's name on the label for an extra special touch."}

question: My wife is trying to leave. She agreed to come back and give me a little time. Even said she hopes I can do it. We buried our first born in Jan 13 years ago. She never got past it. So every year around this time, she gets emotional and says she doesn't think she loves me, but then we go back to normal. This time, another guy came in and showed her attention. I'll forgive the cheating if she'll come home.
answer: I understand how painful this must be for you. It sounds like you have been through a lot with your wife and it is understandable that the events of the past year have been very difficult. It is great that she has agreed to give you some time, but I'm concerned about how much longer you can both keep going through this cycle without getting the help you need."}

question: My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.
answer: It is understandable that you would be feeling overwhelmed and anxious. The first step to managing your fears is to recognize them for what they are: irrational thoughts. You have already acknowledged that you don't find anything incriminating, so it sounds like you need to focus on changing the way you think about the situation. Try replacing these negative thoughts with more positive and realistic ones - such as "my boyfriend loves me and would never do something to hurt me". By taking back control of your thinking, you can reduce your anxieties and find a more balanced outlook. It may also help to talk through your fears with someone who can offer an outside perspective.","speech": ""Hello, my name is John Smith.

question: I have an eating disorder of binging. I've had gastric sleeve surgery. I need help with issues of abuse as a child, addiction, and abusive men. I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist.
answer: It sounds like you are dealing with a lot of difficult things. It is understandable that you may not feel like you are getting the support you need from your therapist. Have you tried speaking to him or her about how you feel? Communication is key in any successful therapeutic relationship, and it could be helpful for you to express what you need from your therapy sessions."}

answer: Have you ever discussed your feelings about the situation with your fiancé?"}

question: I am an international student, and it is my first semester in graduate school in the United States. I faced a cultural shock, and I was so depressed when I arrived here. My counselor in the university was my savior. He helped me a great deal. Now I am going back to my country for a vacation. I was thinking to get him something special with my country's name on it, and I remembered that he likes wine. My country is known for that. Is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after Christmas?
answer: Yes, it is a great idea! A bottle of wine with your country’s name on it would be an excellent, thoughtful present for your therapist. It shows how much you appreciate their help and that you care about them personally. Wine gifts can express gratitude and friendship, so I am sure they will both appreciate the gesture."}

question: A friend of mine taking psychology advised I go to my doctor to check if I have major depressive disorder. I'm afraid of the consequences of doing so. If I do become diagnosed with major depressive disorder, won’t that go on my records? I will never be able to become a counselor along with a list of other things I may be prohibited from. I’m also afraid of taking any anti-depressants. This year, my doctor gave me some for a "dislocated hip." I had a severe reaction and passed out moments after taking them. Everyone I know who has taken anti-depressants says it’s a bad idea all around and you’re better getting treatment without them. I’m concerned they might take me to a clinic and force me to take medication because I am unable to make decisions on my own. I’m not really suicidal, but I am not really taking care of myself either. Someone also told me they still use electroshock therapy. I’m not keen on that. I’m wondering if I am better off just getting self-help and working things out on my own. It’s just that I've been an emotional mess since I was in elementary school. I’ve graduated now and tried to stay positive and be happy, but I cannot deny I still am not good.
answer: It is understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the possibility of being diagnosed with major depressive disorder. If you feel you are in need of medical help, it may be beneficial to seek out a professional who can provide support and guidance. Everyone is different and will respond differently to treatment. It would be beneficial for you to explore your options and find the best course of action that suits your needs. With regards to anti-depressants, it might help to speak with a medical professional as they may be able to offer more insight into how these medications could potentially benefit you without causing any harm. You do not need to make any decisions now but can take time to consider all of your options and make an informed decision that is best for you.", "name": "Anonymous" }

question: I was “mentored” by this guy for a few years spiritually. It was okay at times, but other times, it was just weird. I try not to think about it too much, but a lot of manipulation and lying happened, yet no one else really believed me when I told them. It's like he's two different people, and no one else really sees that side of him. I was blamed for a lot of our troubles, and now we don't really talk much. I'm worried because he's in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything. They just think I'm attacking his character. How do I know for sure?
answer: I understand your concern. It sounds like this person is being dishonest and manipulative, which can be very damaging in a leadership role. Have you talked to anyone else about this? A trusted adult or counselor could help you figure out what to do next. It might also be helpful to look into the resources available from your local church or community for guidance and support."}

question: When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.
answer: Oh, that sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what sets off this reaction?"}

question: I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me "I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you," and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasn’t beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but don't know if I should.
answer: I understand your pain, and it sounds like you've been through a lot. It might help to talk with a therapist about how you feel, and why you feel that way. You deserve to be loved and respected, and it doesn't sound like that was the case in your relationship. A therapist can help you process your emotions and figure out what you need to do next. I hope you can find peace and healing." }

question: I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this. Am I too sensitive? He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings. No matter how often I try to tell him this, he never listens.
answer: It sounds like there is a lot of frustration and disappointment in your relationship with your father. It's important for both of you to find ways to communicate more effectively so that neither of you feels misunderstood or disrespected. Can we talk about some strategies you can use to do this?

question: I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the "perfect guy"? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?
answer: It sounds like you have a difficult decision to make, and one that requires careful consideration of your feelings. Have you had an opportunity to explore why this might be happening? Are there any underlying issues that could be addressed?"}

answer: I understand how difficult it must be to deal with this distrust from your husband. Do you feel like you can open up more about what happened in the past?", "patient": "Yes, of course.

answer: It sounds like you are going through a lot of struggles. Are there any particular issues that you would like to discuss?"}

question: I've worked with this guy for about three years now, and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted. Over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. There was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. We agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, I hoped it would become something more. It didn't, and three months later, I'm still not over it. I'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. We're no longer in the same office, which I thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so I'm still very drawn to him. He's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. He's younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?
answer: I understand how difficult it is to process these feelings and let go of what might have been. It's understandable that you want to maintain the friendship, but you may also need some distance. Is there anyone you can talk to about your feelings who could offer support or a different perspective? Alternatively, exploring other ways to channel these feelings, such as creative outlets, might help you move on."}

question: My husband doesn’t trust me for some past we had. I know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that I am messing around, which I am not.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated and misunderstood. It’s understandable that you want your husband to be more trusting of you. What can you do to try and address this issue? Maybe there is something that you can do together as a couple to help rebuild trust, or some individual things that you could work on to better communicate your feelings and thoughts."}

He's younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?
answer: I understand your feelings for this person are strong, so it might help to talk through them. It's possible that if you open up about how you feel - both about the attraction and about wanting to still have a meaningful relationship - he may be understanding. If not, then you need to decide whether you want to end the friendship or keep it in an artificial way. Either way, it might help to get some perspective on why this person isn't interested in you romantically and how you can both move forward."}

question: I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.
answer: Can you tell me more about your situation? What are some of the challenges you're experiencing with these behaviors?"}

question: I'm a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. She's great. She's funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. We fight a lot. It’s mostly my fault, I must admit. She doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I'm always dreading when a better dude will come along. I don't think she's happy. She's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole "If you love them, let them go," but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I can’t break up with her. I’m literally trapped.
answer: It sounds like you have a difficult relationship and are feeling conflicted about what to do. It's understandable that you would be feeling jealous - it's important to recognize and address those feelings instead of pushing them aside. Is there anything that you can do to reassure yourself and her that your feelings for each other are genuine? It also sounds like you both have some deep-seated issues from the past that need to be worked through in order for this relationship to survive - is there anyone that you two could seek counseling or therapy with?"}

answer: It sounds like you have a difficult situation on your hands, and that you care deeply for this person. It's understandable that you want the best for both of them.

question: My boyfriend and I have not had sex in a couple of weeks. He had to have a cyst removed on his testicles. I have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now, and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him. I'm scared to touch him and get close to him because I'm afraid that I will hurt him.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling a lot of different emotions- frustration, desire, worry, and even fear. It is understandable that you would want to make love to your boyfriend but be hesitant out of concern. What do you think might help you feel more connected with him and lessen these concerns?",

question: I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like your passion lies with basketball, and yet it seems that there is a great deal of pressure from your parents to either continue playing on the team you dislike or to not play at all. Is there anything about the current situation that you would change?",

question: I had to go to the emergency room today to get an X-ray of my spine. My boyfriend didn't want to sit there and wait with me. Instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited. When I was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up. He doesn't understand why I'm mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things. He thinks I don't have a reason to be mad, but I believe that I do.
answer: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with your boyfriend's lack of understanding and his not being there for you during a difficult time. It also sounds like you want him to recognize why you're upset, which may be difficult if he doesn't understand the source of your feelings. Is that correct?",

She has no place to go so I feel like I can’t break up with her. I’m literally trapped.
answer: I understand how difficult this is for you, and that it might seem like an impossible situation. If you're feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope with the relationship any longer, then it might be best to end it. However, if there are ways in which you can work through your trust issues and insecurity together, then that may be a better option for both of you. It sounds like she is willing to stay for now, so it would be beneficial for her to have some support in this period as well. That could involve counselling or couples therapy, if either of you are open to that."

question: I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it’s an emotional nightmare I can’t get to the bottom of. I’ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship? While I’m not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I don’t take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and I’ve talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.
answer: I understand how difficult it is to go through these emotions and deal with them on your own. It may help to talk to a therapist and explore some options that could help you manage your anxiety so that you can be in a relationship if you choose to be. Please consider reaching out to someone who can support you in this journey.",

answer: It sounds like there is some frustration between you both, and it might help if you can talk about why you are feeling this way. It also seems like your boyfriend doesn't understand why you feel the way you do - could you try to explain this to him?"}

question: I just got married with my husband. I have four kids of my own, and he accepts me with my kids. I am thankful he loves my kids even though they’re not his. Now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past. I know all marriages have problems, but sometimes I feel it’s not going to work out if there’s no trust. It’s hard for me to let go because I love him, but I am getting tired.
answer: It is understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed. It is important that both of you take the time to reconnect and openly communicate with one another. You should also work on building trust between yourselves as it is essential for any healthy relationship. Do you think you could try to do this together?",

question: I use to be so happy. No matter what, I always was happy. I got into a relationship with this guy. I love him so much. We’re both teenagers. The week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him. It broke me. He came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other. He comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that I have to lie to her.
answer: It sounds like you love this guy a lot and your mom is making you feel confused and conflicted. How do you feel when you're with him?",

question: It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I’d estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe. I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my father’s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning. After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?
answer: It sounds like you've been through a lot lately and it has taken its toll on your sleeping patterns. It might be helpful to look into techniques such as deep breathing or guided meditation, which could help reduce stress levels and improve the quality of your sleep. Regular exercise can also help keep stress levels in check, and may reduce nightmares. If you're finding it difficult to cope with these feelings on your own, talking to a professional therapist might be beneficial too."}

question: I'm supposed to stay here the rest of my academic life, but I've never liked it here, not even before I came. I’ve never felt like I belong, I’ve missed my country every second in the past four months, and I'm just miserable. I'm gaining weight, doing nothing, and crying for hours straight. Is it time to go back home or is it just culture shock?
answer: It sounds like you are going through a difficult period of adjustment. Culture shock can be very overwhelming and make it seem like there is no way out. It might help to talk about your feelings, worries, and hopes in more detail so that we can explore the various options available to you. Please don't hesitate to share any thoughts or feelings that come up during this conversation."}

question: Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed. I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before. I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship. What can I do?
answer: I understand how difficult it must be to deal with your cousin's words and behavior. It is important that you remember that her comments are not necessarily a reflection of who you are as a person, but instead they may be coming from her own insecurity or frustration. Perhaps it would be beneficial for both of you to talk about how you both can better communicate with one another so that these feelings don't continue to arise." }

He's younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?
answer: I understand your difficulty in getting over this person. You mentioned that you two were very close, so it makes sense to be emotional about it. It might help to focus on the positive memories you share and use those as a way to keep the friendship alive. Maybe take a few moments to reflect on how he made you feel when you were together. Try not to beat yourself up too much either – this is an understandable struggle."}

question: How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they’re gone, I feel sad. It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.
answer: I understand it's difficult to be alone. Have you tried any activities or hobbies to distract yourself?",

question: I'm unemployed just relocated. I can't get approved for a place to live because of past mistakes which follow me to this day. I'm depressed and on the verge of loosing my partner because I'm overwhelmed and have trouble functioning on a daily basis. I see no light at the end of this tunnel and need some help. I see no point in this chaos infested joke some call life.
answer: I understand your frustration, but there is still hope for you to turn your life around. We can work together to find new solutions and strategies that will help you manage your current struggles. You are worth it and deserve a better quality of life."}

question: That phrase makes me crazy. It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change, such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie. Another example is when he opens the front door, the dog runs out if he doesn't pick him up. Over and over again, he lets the dog run out, and I am afraid he will get hit by a car.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated with your husband's lack of awareness about certain safety issues. It might be helpful to have a conversation about how to work together on this so that everyone is safe."}

question: My boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago. I love him, but his dog is wrecking my house. Every day we get home, there is a huge mess on the floor, and several things will be ripped up (including the couch). He's slowly eating all of the doors, and there will be food and poop everywhere. Even though I come home during all of my breaks to take him out, he still poops and pees in the house every chance. I can't financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house. I've tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution, but it never ends well. The dog is the only thing we fight about because I want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesn't want to see him go. It’s not the dog fault though; I understand that. The dog is only a year old, and he isn't a bad dog. He's just too big of a dog for where he is; he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog. I don't hate the dog, but I just can't afford to continue having my house torn to pieces.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by your boyfriend and his dog living together. You mention wanting them both to be happy, so what kind of solutions have you discussed with your boyfriend to resolve this issue?"}

question: I'm a teenager, and I struggle with going out and talking to people. I feel awful about leaving home. I know I can't afford a therapist so I don't know what my problem is, but I think I might have social anxiety.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and anxious about leaving the comfort of your home. It could be helpful to talk with someone who understands how difficult it can be to navigate social situations when dealing with social anxiety. What has been helpful for you in the past when facing social or even school related anxieties?",

question: People who are parental figures in my life have, in the past, hurt me, and some continue to do so. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me. I have had jobs, but I am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong. Any time I bring these things up, I am expected to be over the issue. These are people that you can't just cut out, but I have never received apologies for so much of my pain. I don't know what to do any more. I don't know who I am anymore.
answer: It sounds like these people have caused you a lot of hurt and it has been hard to process alone. What would it be like if you could process these feelings with someone? Would that feel helpful? It might help to talk about how this affects your relationships now, and how to move forward in a healthy way."}

question: That phrase makes me crazy. It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change, such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie. Another example is when he opens the front door, the dog runs out if he doesn't pick him up. Over and over again, he lets the dog run out, and I am afraid he will get hit by a car.
answer: It sounds like you have some frustrations with your husband's behavior that you are not able to talk about openly. Is there something specific you would like to discuss? Maybe we can brainstorm solutions together."}

question: My fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression. She has had it most of her life. Her anxiety in public places is the worst. It gets to points where she can't breathe or move. Sometimes, she won't even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I can't even get her to drive. She doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive. Some people have recommended medication, but I believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. I don't want my fiancée pumped with drugs. I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. When we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. She took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. She slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. I am worried and want to help her without medication.
answer: I understand your concerns about medicating your fiancée. It is important to consider all available options before making a decision. There are many different types of therapy that could be beneficial for her, including cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapies and even art or music therapy. Additionally, a psychiatric service dog may be able to provide the security she needs without medication. I suggest exploring all possible options before making a decision."}

question: My husband and I got into a huge dispute. He said he wanted a divorce, and I left. I still come home a lot and see my kids, and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is. What does that mean for our marriage?
answer: It's difficult to say without more information. It could be that your husband is feeling overwhelmed or scared about taking the next step. Maybe he wants some time to think or process what has happened. It's also possible that he is not sure if he still wants a divorce. Regardless, it sounds like you both need some time and space to figure out what you both want in your relationship."}

question: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
answer: It’s okay. Taking time to reflect on who you are and what you want in life is a journey that everyone takes at different rates of speed. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to explore new things and find out who you are?"} The therapist provides reassurance, acceptance, and validation which allows the patient to open up more about their struggles and feelings.

question: I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.
answer: I understand how difficult that must be for you. It seems like your feelings of anger and frustration are coming from not feeling appreciated or respected by him. Are there any specific requests or boundaries that you would like to set in order to make the relationship more equal?",

question: I have a lot of issues going on right now. First of all, I have a lot of trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel quite tired. I’m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours. Is there something wrong with me and if so what should I do?
answer: It sounds like you're having a difficult time, and it might be helpful to get some more information. Could you tell me more about the sleeping patterns you mentioned, and also share a bit more about the irritability and anxiety attacks?"}

question: I am really worried about one of my friends because I think he has major depression. He disagrees with me on that. He is shut off when it comes to talking to people and telling them how he really feels. He told me he feels empty inside and the only emotions he feels are anger and sadness. I suggested to him to get help and talk to his mom about it but he refuses.
answer: It's understandable that your friend is hesitant to seek help, especially if he is feeling ashamed or embarrassed. It may be helpful to suggest a counselor who specializes in adolescent mental health and talk with his parents about the importance of helping him get the support he needs. Perhaps you could also reach out to a hotline or crisis center for further advice on how to approach the situation.}

question: I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.
answer: It is natural to feel this way when you are feeling alone. Maybe talking to someone could help ease these feelings? You don't have to go through it by yourself."}

question: I like getting attention from men. I don't have sex. I lead them on to thinking I might want to. I like to tease, I like for men to chase me, and I like to feel wanted.

question: I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.
answer: It sounds like you have a lot of feelings around this issue. Is there anything you can tell me about when these thoughts and urges start? Are they always present or do they come and go? Do they cause you distress or are you able to manage them?"}

question: I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.
answer: It sounds like you are feeling very lonely. Is there anyone you can talk to about how you are feeling? It might help to get your feelings out in the open."}

question: I am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. He has a girlfriend who is always with him. He never hangs out with me anymore. We were really close, and it is making me really sad.
answer: I'm sorry to hear that you feel like you are losing your connection with your brother. What do you think might help bring the two of you closer together again?"}

question: I've been hurt by a man for five years. He doesn't involve me with the family or kids. Everyone in the family is against me. There is a Mass today for a family member, and he never asked me to go. I'm to sit home alone now and Christmas too. He expects me to sit alone while he enjoys being with the family. We are in our 50s, and it hurts that he won't even think of me or involve me as part of the family. He doesn't even care. I am leaving him as soon as possible, but I hurt so bad that I didn't know who to turn too. I'm now in this low funk of depression, and I'm scared because I do stupid things to myself and give up. I have no friends because I was a truck driver. I've been getting serious headaches and can't sleep. I don't eat; I've lost my appetite. This has been going on for a couple weeks now.
answer: I'm so sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. It must be very difficult and painful. What do you need from me? How can I help?"}

question: I found out today that my wife is cheating on me. I love her, but she won’t tell the truth even when I have proof. When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.
answer: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It seems like you need some space to process what is happening. Can we talk about it more next week?")

question: I never get infections or scars or anything, and it doesn't bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something, but I'm concerned.
answer: It's understandable to be worried about this. What can you do to help manage your concerns?", "patient": "I don't know. Maybe get checked out by a doctor or something?"}

question: I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal. Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.
answer: I understand how hard it is to wait for finding the right person and having sex for the first time. You said that you want to wait for your first boyfriend, but what if he doesn't come around soon? Is there anything else you could try in the meantime?" {

question: At school, it feels like I've lost all my friends, and I've been really weird with my sleeping patterns. I used to cut myself, and I really want to again, but I change in the locker rooms because I don’t want anybody to see. I get ticked off easy and overreact. At night, I’m very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff. Please help me. I just want to be happy again, and I feel like I’m starting to fake a smile at school.
answer: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds really tough. Is there anything specific you need help with? Anything that might make it easier for you at school?"}

question: For my whole life, I’ve been very unconfident, insecure, and self-questioning. I'm super quiet because I'm scared of what people will think of me. I avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety. It is how both of my parents have always been, and I feel like I'm doomed to that life also. It makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because I’m too nice. It causes me depression and brings me down. I’m in my early twenties, and I really need to create a better life for myself. I've been like this for so long, so how do I change?

answer: It is normal to feel anxious about this situation, but there are many things that you can do in order to find a boyfriend or even lose your virginity. Firstly, you should focus on developing yourself and your interests outside of dating. Meetup with other people who share the same interests as you. You could also take online classes or join activities which will help you meet new people and make friends. Secondly, try to be open-minded about opportunities that come your way. When a guy is interested in getting to know you better, do not close the door immediately. Instead, give him an opportunity to get to know the real you. Finally, do not be afraid to take initiative and ask guys out on dates. You can start by finding common ground with them and then take it from there.", "therapist2": "It is okay to feel anxious about this situation, but there are many things that you can do in order to find a boyfriend or even lose your virginity.

question: I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. In the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else. These situations were never more than just kissing. I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. I love him so much and want to work things out too, but I'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. I can't seem to forgive myself. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.
answer: It is natural to feel guilty and unworthy after making mistakes in relationships. It is also commendable that you were open and honest about these situations with your boyfriend, and he chose to forgive and move forward with you. One way of looking at this is as an opportunity for growth - for both of you. Have a discussion with your boyfriend about how you both can take advantage of this opportunity to learn more about each other, communicate better in the future, and strengthen your relationship. This is a chance to deepen the trust between you and create something even stronger. You could also look into couples counseling if you feel that might help.",
