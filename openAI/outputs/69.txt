 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call. I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?", "therapist": "I understand why you are feeling this way, and I think that it is important for you to figure out what it is that you want from a relationship. You need to have a clear idea of the type of person that you would like to be with so that you can make sure that your choices are based on those criteria and not just impulsive decisions. It might help if you list all the qualities that you desire in a partner, so that when an opportunity arises, you will be able to make a more informed decision about whether or not it is something worth pursuing. Above all else, I want you to remember that you deserve to feel safe and secure, and that you do not need to settle for anything less than what makes you happy."}
