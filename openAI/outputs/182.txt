 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person. Before, he worked and slept, and on off days, he'd stay home because he didn't want to do anything else. Now he's going out with friends several nights a week while I'm still home working a 50 hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself. He's suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife, but the whole time, I'm remembering how I've been emotionally starving for the last five years.", "therapist": "I understand this must be difficult for you. Can you tell me more about how it has affected your relationship with your husband?", "patient": "He ignores my texts and emails, doesn't have time to talk when I call him, and is distant in person. He says he loves me but it's hard to believe him. We used to connect on a deeper level, but it feels like that part of our relationship has gone away with him being so busy all the time. Whenever I bring this up, he gets angry or shuts down and won't talk about it anymore."}
