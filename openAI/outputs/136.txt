 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again. I don't know what to do.", "therapist": "That is a difficult situation for you to be in. It sounds like you have been in an exploitative relationship with this therapist, where he took advantage of your trust and friendship to gain access to your finances. This is not acceptable behavior, and I can understand why it would feel overwhelming. Please reach out to a hotline or support group for survivors of abuse and exploitation, as well as a lawyer specializing in these types of cases. It may be helpful to talk with other people who have experienced similar situations, so you do not feel alone in this journey."}
