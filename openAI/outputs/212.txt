 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My husband doesnâ€™t trust me for some past we had. I know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that I am messing around, which I am not.", "therapist": "I understand how difficult it must be to deal with this distrust from your husband. Do you feel like you can open up more about what happened in the past?", "patient": "Yes, of course. We had a fight when he caught me talking to an ex-friend. He said I was not being honest and now he does not trust me again."}
