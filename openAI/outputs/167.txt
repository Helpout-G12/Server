He fights just to leave. One day, he's happy. The next, he's mean and blames me for everything. He can't admit faults. He thinks he's perfect and does no wrong.", "therapist": "It sounds like there is a lot of frustration and pain in your relationship. It also seems that you are looking to the other person to make you feel better, which is not possible. Could you tell me more about how this pattern started? What kind of things do you do together, and what do his friends have to do with it?"}

He always says I’m too sensitive, but I just want us to be happy together. We used to have fun, now it’s all argument. He said he loves me, yet he seems to forget. We were supposed to go out yesterday, and then at the last minute he called to say he couldn't come. This is really hurting me.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling very frustrated and hurt by this situation. Do you think you could tell me more about what happened between you? What happened with his call, for example? How do you feel when he behaves in these ways?"}
