 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?", "therapist": "It sounds like you're dealing with an emotional situation at work that needs to be addressed. In order to protect yourself, it may be helpful to seek counseling and have a third-party mediator to talk through your experiences and come up with strategies for moving forward. I suggest speaking with an employment lawyer about the legal aspects of this situation and then deciding if therapy would be beneficial for you. Good luck!"}
