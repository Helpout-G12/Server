 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls. I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl too. I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything. I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl.", "therapist": "It sounds like you have a strong inner sense of who you are and what feels right to you. It is understandable that you would prefer to express yourself as a female. You could explore how your gender identity fits into the larger context of your life, such as how it relates to your relationships with others and what kind of career path you want to pursue."}
