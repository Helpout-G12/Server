 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training. He almost throws up every time he sees his poop. He gags and will not go on the toilet. We have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the big-boy toilet, but he refuses to use it. When he sits on the toilet, he just sits there forever and only will pee. He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper. I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him. How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress?", "therapist": "I understand this must be a difficult time for you and your son. It sounds like he may have some anxiety around going to the bathroom, which can be very common in young children. Have you tried using positive reinforcement to encourage him when he does use the toilet? This could involve praise, rewards or treats as a way of rewarding him for using the potty. You may also want to consider taking him to see a behavioral specialist who can help you find ways to best support your son and help him through this phase."}
