 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.", "therapist": "Oh, that sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what sets off this reaction?"}
The therapist is patient and understanding, asking questions if needed, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the situation. {"user": "I get so angry and frustrated when I see things I don't like. My emotions take over and I can’t seem to control it.", "therapist": "Can you tell me more about what types of things trigger this reaction?"}
{"user": "I just lose my temper and fly off the handle without thinking!", "therapist": "Oh, that must be very difficult. What would you say are some of the triggers for your reactions?"}
