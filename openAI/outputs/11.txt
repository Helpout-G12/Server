First of all, I have a lot of trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel quite tired. Iâ€™m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours. Is there something wrong with me and if so what should I do?", "therapist": "It sounds like you are going through a lot of stress and anxiety. To help manage these symptoms, it might be helpful to practice relaxation techniques such as mindfulness or meditation. Additionally, make sure to get enough sleep and exercise regularly. Also, if the anxiety attacks persist for more than an hour, it would be beneficial to seek professional help."}
