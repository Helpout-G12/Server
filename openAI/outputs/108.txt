 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family to help me. I have no money for therapy, but I think I need therapy before I can secure a job.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are going through a difficult time. It is understandable why having a strained relationship with your mother would be stressful. Do you feel comfortable talking more about this?", "user": "Yes, absolutely."}
