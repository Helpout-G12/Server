 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My ex-boyfriend, will not stop harassing and stalking me. We work together. I honestly think he needs help to move on. His accusations are angry lies. But I think he may believe them to be true.", "therapist": "I understand this must be very difficult for you. It sounds like your ex-boyfriend is having a hard time letting go and it might be helpful if someone could talk to him about his feelings. What do you think would help?"}
{"user": "I'm not sure what to do. I feel so lost and alone", "therapist": "It can be very overwhelming when we don't know what direction to take in life. How can I help?"}
