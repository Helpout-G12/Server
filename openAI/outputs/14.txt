 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "The last of my emotions belong to my pets. Today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow. If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says "here lays my emotions. R.I.P." I practically have no emotions left and I came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my family's. What's wrong with me?", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Is there anything specific that is causing stress or anxiety for you?}
P: Yes, my dad said he might get rid of my pets tomorrow.
T: Oh no, that must be really difficult for you. What do you think would happen if they were gone?
P: I don't know. They are like my only source of joy and comfort so I guess I wouldn't have anything else to look forward to. It might even trigger more deep depression or something. I already feel numb most of the time.
T: That must be very difficult for you. Do you think there is anyone who could help you process these feelings?
