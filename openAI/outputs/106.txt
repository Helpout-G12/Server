 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist.

I was very upset none the less. I understand what she did was wrong, but I want to spend the rest of my life with her. So I'm willing to forgive and move on. We have been together for a little over 9 years, and we have a son. At the beginning of our relationship, I was unfaithful and she caught me cheating. She forgave me for what I've done to her and since then I been completely faithful. I'm worried about our relationship and want to move forward but its been very unsettling. All I can think about is her with another man. I don't know what to do or where to go for advice?", "therapist": "I understand how difficult it must be for you. It sounds like you have already forgiven your partner and want to move forward, but the thought of them being intimate with another person is still very distressing. Have you two discussed what happened and what each other's intentions are? Open communication is key in any relationship, so I would recommend that if you are both willing to try and make it work, then this should be the first step towards rebuilding trust and understanding one another."}

I have no appetite and have lost my enjoyment of things. I also can't seem to focus on anything. I feel like I am in a fog and don't understand what is happening. I just want to feel better", "therapist": "It sounds like you may be feeling depressed. Is there something specific that has happened recently that might be causing this? If so, it would be helpful to talk about it and process any related feelings."}
