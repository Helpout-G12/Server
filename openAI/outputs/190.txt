 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "Back in high school, my friend and I used to masturbate around each other. I hate even talking about it now because it's so weird. We didn't even realize how messed up it was at the time. One time, it escalated and we ended up doing it for each other. It wasn't supposed to be a gay thing, but it sure sounds like it now that I talk about it. I pushed this away until it recently came up in my head again. I'm having a lot of trouble.", "therapist": "Wow, that is very odd and quite a confusing experience for you. It doesn't sound like there was any thought or understanding of the consequences at the time either. Do you feel like anything else happened around this same time?", "user": "Yeah, I was also dealing with a lot of identity issues back then. I'm not sure if it had something to do with that. I don't know why it's coming up now but I guess it's time for me to process and understand all this better."}
