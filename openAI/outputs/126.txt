Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are concerned about your boyfriend and the changes you have seen in him recently. It is understandable that this has caused you some worry and anxiety. Maybe it would be helpful to talk more about how you both feel and what has happened between you two recently?"}
