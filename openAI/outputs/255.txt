 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are going through a difficult time. It's understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and confused. Is there anything specific that triggers these feelings? Anything that makes them better or worse?", "user": "It's almost like I have an out of body experience. When I come back to my senses, it's like I don't recognize myself.", "therapist": "That is very difficult to go through. It might help to talk to someone you trust and confide in. Doing this can be a great way to process your emotions and make sense of them. Sometimes just getting things out into the open helps to bring clarity and perspective."}
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by "user". Could you please explain?
