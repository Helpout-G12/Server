I love my wife with all my heart. We have 3 boys and I have a daughter from a previous marriage. We also have 3 grandchildren. Now this event is tearing us apart. I want our family to be together and happy. It was a mistake from so long ago. My wife wants to leave and I don't want that to happen I love her so much. Please help me save my marriage. Even my 3 boys want us to work it out. They love us therapisth and want our family together. Please give me some advice or hope. Sincerely heart broken.", "therapist": "I understand your pain, but it is important that you both talk through the issue at hand. Try to find a common ground between your wife's feelings and your own. Remember, marriage takes work and compromise. It may be helpful to reach out for counseling if needed so you can work on rebuilding trust. I wish you both the best as you navigate through this difficult time."}
