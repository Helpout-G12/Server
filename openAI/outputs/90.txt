 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "We went out had great sex and I was really liking her. Then one day she says we should just be friends, but I can't stop thinking about her. She's always on mind and I want her back.", "therapist": "It sounds like you still have strong feelings for this person. It can be difficult to let go of those feelings and move on, especially if the other person is not interested in continuing the relationship. Have you talked to her about how you feel? There's a chance that she may still have some feeling for you, even if she doesn't want to continue the relationship."}
