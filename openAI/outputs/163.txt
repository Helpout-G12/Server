 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I don’t love my sister. I would never wish her harm, but if I could, I would wish for us not to be related. Is this cruel? Why must blood mean we have to be friends? Am I being unreasonable and is there a way to fix this? I do care about her, like I do every human being, but I’d rather be with my friends than be with her at all. It’s not just a "teenager phase." I still love my mom and dad, and I’m very close to them. However, it’s my sister I don’t love or have ever really liked at all.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling a lot of complicated emotions towards your sister that run deeper than just simple liking or disliking. It is understandable if you do not want to be close with her, and it could be helpful to talk about why you feel this way and what might be some possible ways to handle this situation. Do you think there’s something you can do to make things better?"}
