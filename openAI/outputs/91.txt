 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "She cried because she lost all trust in me. Now I feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed, what do I do?", "therapist": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be very difficult for you. Could you tell me more about how you feel?"}
The therapist listens attentively and responds with empathy. {"user": "She said it felt like I don't care about her anymore, which made me realize I was wrong. But now I just want to die inside.", "therapist": "It sounds like you have been feeling very lonely and helpless. Is there anything I can do to help?"}
