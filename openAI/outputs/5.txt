 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call. I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?", "therapist": "It sounds like you are looking for a deeper connection but are not sure how to go about finding it or making it work once you have found it. The most important thing is to set boundaries and expectations, both in the relationship and with yourself. Setting clear boundaries of what is acceptable behavior will help you feel more secure that you are being respected as an individual, rather than someone who is just there to fulfill needs. It also helps create a space where both parties can engage in meaningful conversations and learn from each other. Additionally, recognizing and validating your own needs and wants is essential for finding a healthy balance. It might be helpful to talk through some of these ideas with a therapist to explore ways of making the necessary changes. Good luck on your journey!"}
