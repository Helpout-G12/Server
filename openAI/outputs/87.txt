 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating. What advice might you offer?", "therapist": "It sounds like your partner may be overwhelmed by stress and negativity. It's important to be mindful of how you communicate, as even the smallest things can have an effect on one another. One way to ensure that both parties feel heard and respected is to use active listening. This involves making eye contact, nodding your head and using phrases such as \"I understand\" or \"please continue\". Additionally, it may be helpful to take breaks from conversations when they become too heated. Taking a few moments to breathe deeply and collect your thoughts can help both parties find a more productive way of communicating. Finally, it might also be beneficial to practice self-care. This can involve anything from meditation to exercise which can help both partners stay calm, collected and open to communication."}
