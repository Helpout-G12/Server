 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I'm in a relationship, but I feel like I'm always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated. My ex told me that I will never find anyone else, and that's lingering in the back of my mind.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed with this relationship. How do you feel when you think about breaking up with your partner?", "user": "I don't know. I just don't want to give up on it yet."}
