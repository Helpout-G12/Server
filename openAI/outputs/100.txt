 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I have recently separated from my husband whom I have been with for 5 years. Throughout our 5 years together, I have stood by him through 2 affairs, him talking to other women while I was pregnant, his drug abuse and thru verbal and physical abuse.", "therapist": "I'm so sorry you had to experience that. It sounds like a very difficult situation to be in. How did the separation come about? Was it something that you decided together or was it forced upon him? Were there any other factors involved such as financial struggles or family interference?"}
