 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist.

I can't get approved for a place to live because of past mistakes which follow me to this day. I'm depressed and on the verge of loosing my partner because I'm overwhelmed and have trouble functioning on a daily basis. I see no light at the end of this tunnel and need some help. I see no point in this chaos infested joke some call life.", "therapist": "I understand your frustration, but there is still hope for you to turn your life around. We can work together to find new solutions and strategies that will help you manage your current struggles. You are worth it and deserve a better quality of life."}
