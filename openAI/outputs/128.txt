 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me. This rollercoaster is crazy.", "therapist": "It can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to feel that way. I'm here if you want to talk about it."}
The patient: {user} feels like they are going insane sometimes with all of the emotions and thoughts swirling around in their head. They don't know how to make sense of them or who to turn to for help.
The therapist: I understand, and it is okay to feel overwhelmed. I am here if you want to talk about anything that you need help processing. It can be a difficult journey navigating your feelings, but you don't have to do it alone.
