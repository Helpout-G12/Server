 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I keep hearing I am attractive from people around me, and I think I believe it. But I have low confidence regarding approaching girls I like.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling some conflict about peopleâ€™s opinions of you. What do you think is causing this confusion?", "user": "I think I might be embarrassed to express how I feel because I'm not sure if they will reciprocate my feelings."}

Answer: Yes, it sounds like you are feeling confused and uncertain due to the conflicting opinions of others. It is natural to feel shy when you want to express your feelings but are not sure if the other person will reciprocate. In order to find a balance between these conflicting opinions and your own feelings, I suggest that you focus on developing a deeper understanding of yourself. This can help you better recognize what it is you truly desire and how to best approach it. To do so, try keeping a journal or talking to a trusted friend or mentor about the topics that confuse you. This practice may be helpful in helping you find clarity and empowering you to move forward.

Answer: Yes, this could be a sign of low self-esteem and a fear of rejection. It might help to practice assertiveness training or cognitive behavioural therapy to work through these feelings. Alternatively, if you are comfortable with yourself and confident in your ability to talk to someone, then it can be beneficial to just practice what to say and how to act. You could also consider taking some small steps such as sending a card or email rather than approaching them in person. Practicing assertiveness or CBT can help you work through your doubts, whilst preparing yourself for any potential rejection can at least give you the confidence to approach someone even if you feel unsure of how they will respond.
