 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.", "therapist": "It sounds like you both need to have a serious conversation about your expectations for the relationship, and also how to make sure that intimacy and trust are maintained. It's great that she made an effort to initiate sex tonight - this could be a great opportunity to talk about what works best for both of you in terms of creating a romantic environment."}
corvid_crow: I think your approach is spot on - it sounds like she needs some reassurance that you're not dissatisfied and that her orgasms are real. Acknowledging the difficulty of the situation, it might be helpful to set aside time for just talking and being intimate (with no pressure or expectations), so that when things start getting more sexual, there's a better foundation for trust and communication.
My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/communication and trust. We're working through it, but sometimes things feel quite fragile. I often feel like she expects me to read her mind or knows what I want without telling me, which leads to frustration on both sides when things don't go as planned.
I'm a bit worried about the "lack of intimacy/communication and trust" part - does that sound accurate? If so, do you have any advice for us? We are both very passionate people but it can be hard to find common ground sometimes. We have had some good conversations lately and I feel like we're making progress, but I'm still a bit worried about this intimacy/communication thing. Thanks in advance!
I think you’ve identified the root of your issues quite accurately. It can be hard to find common ground sometimes, particularly when it comes to sex. It sounds like you both need to have a serious conversation about your expectations for the relationship, and also how to make sure that intimacy and trust are maintained. It’s great that she made an effort to initiate sex tonight - this could be a great opportunity to talk about what works best for both of you in terms of communication, expectations, and getting your needs met.
