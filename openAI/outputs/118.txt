 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why. For me it seemed out of the blue. I don't miss her as much as I used to but I just don't trust people anymore, not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family. I'm so terrified of being judged or dismissed. Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, I've just shut down. I haven't felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart. I'm scared to because I don't want it to be taken away from me again. I feel like ever lesson I learn only last a day. I just don't know what to do. I'm working at a place I know I should enjoy. I'm keeping up with my creative passions: working out, eating healthy, etc. I'm doing everything the books say I should do, but I don't feel any different. I just don't know what to do.", "therapist": "I understand how difficult it is to trust people after going through such a painful experience. It might help you to remember that everyone is unique and has their own story and experiences. You could try reaching out to your friends and family, and letting them know what you're feeling. That way they can support you and remind you of the good things in your life. As for trusting yourself, I suggest taking baby steps. Try to focus on one thing at a time, like working on a project or going for a walk. You could also try journaling about how you feel and what is important to you. Taking things slowly can help you find the strength to move forward with hope and courage."}
