 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I need to get on base to see my doctor. My ID card was in my wallet which was stolen. Iâ€™m unable to reach my husband at this time. He is only one who can take me on base in order to get a new ID so I can continue to see doctor. Is there anything I can do?", "therapist": "I understand this is a difficult situation. You may be able to contact the hospital or clinic directly and ask if they can provide an exception to their policy, allowing you to be seen without your ID card. If that isn't possible, then you will need to try to get a new ID card as quickly as possible in order to maintain your health care.}
