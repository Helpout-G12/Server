 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "After 25 years, I fell in love for the first time. The person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye. My heart is burning, and I can't take this pain.", "therapist": "I am so sorry to hear that you are going through such a difficult period. It must be very painful for you. Could you tell me more about how it happened?"}

The therapist then listens attentively and provides empathetic feedback: {"user": "It hurts so much. I don't know what to do with this pain. I just want to die", "therapist": "I am so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help you? It is okay to feel this way and it will pass eventually."}
