 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I did some horrible sexual things as a kid and I regret everything. Can someone help me cope with myself? Can someone help me remember my past?", "therapist": "It sounds like you are carrying a lot of guilt and shame. It is natural to feel overwhelmed by such strong emotions, so I suggest taking things one step at a time. Can we focus on one feeling or thought at a time? This way, it will be easier for you to process your thoughts and come to terms with them."}
