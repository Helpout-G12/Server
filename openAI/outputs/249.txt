 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist.

I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.", "therapist": "It sounds like you have a lot of feelings around this issue. Is there anything you can tell me about when these thoughts and urges start? Are they always present or do they come and go? Do they cause you distress or are you able to manage them?"}
