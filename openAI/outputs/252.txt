 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I've been hurt by a man for five years. He doesn't involve me with the family or kids. Everyone in the family is against me. There is a Mass today for a family member, and he never asked me to go. I'm to sit home alone now and Christmas too. He expects me to sit alone while he enjoys being with the family. We are in our 50s, and it hurts that he won't even think of me or involve me as part of the family. He doesn't even care. I am leaving him as soon as possible, but I hurt so bad that I didn't know who to turn too. I'm now in this low funk of depression, and I'm scared because I do stupid things to myself and give up. I have no friends because I was a truck driver. I've been getting serious headaches and can't sleep. I don't eat; I've lost my appetite. This has been going on for a couple weeks now.", "therapist": "I'm so sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. It must be very difficult and painful. What do you need from me? How can I help?"}

Astronauts Visiting the Moon
Today, October 31st, is the anniversary of the first human visit to the surface of the moon. On this day in 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface while Michael Collins orbited in a command module. This was the culmination of the Apollo 11 mission, which successfully completed the goal set by President John F. Kennedy in May 1961 to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. As we look back at this historic event, it’s worth considering how far space exploration has come since then and what it might bring in the future.
