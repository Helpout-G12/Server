 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "For the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. I'm at my wits end. How can I get them to stop and get along?", "therapist": "It sounds like a difficult situation for you and your family. I think it is important for both of your children to learn healthy ways of resolving conflicts. Can we brainstorm some strategies together that might help in this process?"}
Returning to School: {"user": "I am so anxious about my daughter returning to school after the summer holidays. She has always been a good student, but I'm concerned about how she will cope with all of the changes this year. How can I help her adjust and feel comfortable at school?", "therapist": "It is natural to be worried about your daughter returning to school after the summer holidays. It can be a difficult transition for some students, particularly those who are highly motivated and achieve good results. You could try talking to her about any concerns she may have, and brainstorm strategies for adjusting to the changes at school. Additionally, you could arrange a meeting with the teacher or the guidance counsellor to discuss her transition back to school."}
