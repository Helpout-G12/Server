 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. Iâ€™m coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.", "therapist": "It is normal and healthy to take time to adjust to a major life change, especially one as difficult as a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath. Everyone grieves differently and at their own pace. It may help to talk with someone about the loss you have experienced, as well as the changes in your life. Please know that you are not alone and that it is okay to ask for help when needed." }
