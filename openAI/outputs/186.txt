 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My husband always works. He does work from home, but his hours are from morning until night, and he neglects his family. If I have anything I want to do, I have to find a babysitter, but he does what he wants. He rarely comes to bed when I do, and we never have date nights.", "therapist": "That must be very frustrating for you. It sounds like your needs aren't being met, and it would seem that this is causing tension in the relationship. Do you feel comfortable talking about why this bothers you?"}
The patient nods, and begins to open up more. {"user": "I guess I just want to be a priority in his life. He always puts work first, even when he's home, so it makes me feel like an outsider in my own marriage."} The therapist listens intently, and encourages the patient to talk further if they wish.
