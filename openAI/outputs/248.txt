 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Is there anything specific that is causing this feeling? It could be helpful to talk about what is going on for you and to explore possible solutions. You don’t have to go through this alone, and I'm here to listen and support you."}
