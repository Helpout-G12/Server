 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "When I ask him who he is talking to, he tells me no one. But, it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone. I have even accused him of having a secret cell phone. I ask so much, I feel like I am losing it. Is he trying to make me question my sanity, or is he talking to himself?", "therapist": "I understand that this must be very confusing and worrying for you. It is important to remember that everyone is unique and has their own way of dealing with things. Maybe your loved one is just talking out loud to himself as a way of sorting through thoughts and ideas."}
