 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this. Am I too sensitive? He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings. No matter how often I try to tell him this, he never listens.", "therapist": "It sounds like there is a lot of frustration and disappointment in your relationship with your father. It's important for both of you to find ways to communicate more effectively so that neither of you feels misunderstood or disrespected. Can we talk about some strategies you can use to do this? What has worked well in the past when you have had difficult conversations? Do you feel comfortable sharing what you need from your father in order to feel supported and respected?"}
