 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I regret ever hurting her and they mean the world to me. But it feels like nothing I do seem to work. I'll always love them no matter what and when I'm with them nothing else matters. I love them more then anything. I don't want another guy raising my kids.", "therapist": "It sounds like you have a lot of love for your family. It can be difficult to know how to show that love in the way that is most beneficial and meaningful for them. Is there anything specific that you are looking for advice on, or just generally exploring different ways of showing your love?"}
