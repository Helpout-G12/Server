 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?", "therapist": "I think you are doing a great job at pushing through adversity, and itâ€™s natural to become overwhelmed when feeling like our efforts are not enough. Is there anyone in your life you could talk to about how you feel? Sometimes just getting things out into the open helps to make a situation seem more manageable."}
