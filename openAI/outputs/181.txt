 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I use to be so happy. No matter what, I always was happy. I got into a relationship with this guy. I love him so much. Weâ€™re therapisth teenagers. The week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him. It broke me. He came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other. He comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that I have to lie to her.", "therapist": "I understand it is difficult to be separated from your partner. Is there anything else going on in your life that might be contributing to the stress?", "user": "My grades are dropping and I'm not eating or sleeping well. I feel so alone, like no one understands how much this hurts."}
