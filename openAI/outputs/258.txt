 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "At school, it feels like I've lost all my friends, and I've been really weird with my sleeping patterns. I used to cut myself, and I really want to again, but I change in the locker rooms because I don’t want anybody to see. I get ticked off easy and overreact. At night, I’m very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff. Please help me. I just want to be happy again, and I feel like I’m starting to fake a smile at school.", "therapist": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds really tough. Is there anything specific you need help with? Anything that might make it easier for you at school?"}
No one else is responsible for your happiness but yourself, and it’s okay to not be okay. Reach out if you feel like you need someone to talk to. #MentalHealthAwareness #SelfCare #Anxiety
