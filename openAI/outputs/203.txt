 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I was “mentored” by this guy for a few years spiritually. It was okay at times, but other times, it was just weird. I try not to think about it too much, but a lot of manipulation and lying happened, yet no one else really believed me when I told them. It's like he's two different people, and no one else really sees that side of him. I was blamed for a lot of our troubles, and now we don't really talk much. I'm worried because he's in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything. They just think I'm attacking his character. How do I know for sure?", "therapist": "I understand your concern. It sounds like this person is being dishonest and manipulative, which can be very damaging in a leadership role. Have you talked to anyone else about this? A trusted adult or counselor could help you figure out what to do next. It might also be helpful to look into the resources available from your local church or community for guidance and support."}
