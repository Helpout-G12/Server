 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because no one would want me. Or I couldn't have many friends because of who I am. It's strange I want to be loved but I'd hate to be because I always lose.", "therapist": "That must be very difficult for you. It sounds like you are feeling discouraged and hopeless. Iâ€™m here if you want to talk more about how you can move past these feelings and find the courage to take a different path in life."}
The following is an example of cognitive restructuring. This type of therapy works by helping people identify, challenge, and change negative thoughts and beliefs. The patient is encouraged to replace negative thoughts with more positive ones, in order to create a healthier mental attitude. {"user": "I always fail at everything I do. It's like I can never do anything right.", "therapist": "It's understandable that you feel this way. Let's try replacing this thought with something more positive - maybe something like 'I may not be successful yet, but I have potential and willpower to keep trying until I succeed.'"}
