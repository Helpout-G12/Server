 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I have no sex drive due to medical issues. I’ve shut down completely and closed everyone out. I’ve even told my husband that I wanted a divorce since that’s what I thought he wanted to hear. However, it devastated me when I learned he's seeing someone else. I’ve since told him that I wanted to work things out but he’s not sure I actually mean it. He thinks the only reason I want him back is because I’m jealous. How do I show him I’m serious?", "therapist": "I understand how difficult this must be for you. It's important that you communicate clearly and honestly with your husband, so he knows you are sincere in wanting to work things out. Acknowledge his feelings, recognize the trust has been broken, and share with him what you can do to rebuild it. You may also want to consider couples counseling to help both of you process these difficult emotions and build a stronger foundation for your marriage."}
