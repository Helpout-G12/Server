 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My ex-boyfriend and I met over a year ago. We hit it off and fell in love pretty quick. However, he has trust issues and assumed I was cheating. When I found out I was pregnant, we had just broken up. Five months later, I lost the baby, and we did not speak for a few weeks. Now we are talking, and he says he loves me but is afraid I will hurt him "again." I just want to know where to go with this because I love him so much, and I want to get back to us being happy and a family.", "therapist": "It sounds like you both have had a difficult time lately. It's understandable that he has trust issues, but it also sounds like he still cares for you deeply. Is there anything you can do to help him process his feelings of insecurity? You could try to talk openly and gently about how he is feeling and reassure him that you are committed to making the relationship work. The two of you might benefit from speaking with a counselor together, as well."}
