How can I stop it? I know the mistakes that I've made in my life. I'm having a really hard time getting back on my feet. Can you help me please?", "therapist": "I understand how difficult this is for you. You have to learn to recognize the patterns and then make different choices so that you can feel safe, secure and respected. We can work together to explore these patterns, understand why they may be happening, and come up with strategies on how to create healthy boundaries in your relationships. Together we will find ways to help you take back control of your life and find the peace and joy that you so rightly deserve."}
