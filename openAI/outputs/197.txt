 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.", "therapist": "It is understandable that you would be feeling overwhelmed and anxious. The first step to managing your fears is to recognize them for what they are: irrational thoughts. You have already acknowledged that you don't find anything incriminating, so it sounds like you need to focus on changing the way you think about the situation. Try replacing these negative thoughts with more positive and realistic ones - such as "my boyfriend loves me and would never do something to hurt me". By taking back control of your thinking, you can reduce your anxieties and find a more balanced outlook. It may also help to talk through your fears with someone who can offer an outside perspective.","speech": ""Hello, my name is John Smith.
