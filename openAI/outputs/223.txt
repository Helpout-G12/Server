 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I'm a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. She's great. She's funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. We fight a lot. It’s mostly my fault, I must admit. She doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I'm always dreading when a better dude will come along. I don't think she's happy. She's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole "If you love them, let them go," but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I can’t break up with her. I’m literally trapped.", "therapist": "I understand how difficult this is for you, and that it might seem like an impossible situation. If you're feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope with the relationship any longer, then it might be best to end it. However, if there are ways in which you can work through your trust issues and insecurity together, then that may be a better option for both of you. It sounds like she is willing to stay for now, so it would be beneficial for her to have some support in this period as well. That could involve counselling or couples therapy, if either of you are open to that."
