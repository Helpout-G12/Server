 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I’m a senior high school student. I’m also five months pregnant. I got pregnant by my boyfriend of three years. My parents don’t want us to communicate with each other. He can’t even come to visit my gynecologist. My mom goes to attend all of my doctor’s appointments. She’s supportive of me. I wish, though, that my boyfriend was next to me and be able to see his daughter on a sonogram, at the very least. My family does not understand that he deserves that much. I cry all the time because I feel lost and hopeless. I need guidance and I believe that you can give it to me. Am I wrong for wanting him around? Are they right for keeping him away from the appointments and not letting us communicate with each other even though we are the parents? I do everything that they ask of me. I just want him to be around. When I ask my parents to let him be here, they call me a selfish person. Please help me.", "therapist": "I understand how difficult this must be for you. Your parents' wishes can be hard to accept and it is normal to feel lost and hopeless in times like these. It might help to talk to your boyfriend about what bothers your parents, so they don't feel excluded from the process. Also, if he truly cares for you and your baby, he should want to be part of this journey together with you. Please remember that you are not alone in this, and I am here for you if you need somebody to talk to."}
