 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling very alone and like something is missing when you don't open up and share. Is there anything else that causes this feeling?", "user": "No, that’s it."}
