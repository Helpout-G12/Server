 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again. I don't know what to do.", "therapist": "It sounds like you have a lot of trust and faith in this therapist. It might be helpful for you to take some time to reflect on why you chose to loan him money and why you trusted him with your credit card information. Does it feel right to you that he didn't come back when you needed him? How can I support you in making decisions about this situation?"}
