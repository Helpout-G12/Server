 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I have been with a guy for 4 years, he's a great guy and we also have a son together. The problem is that I'm in love with a guy that I've been talking to for about 2 years but I've never met him in person. Honestly I'm bored with the relationship I have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the second guy, I don't know how to tell him that. What should I do?", "therapist": "It sounds like you are in a difficult situation where you feel stuck between two men. You mentioned feeling bored with your current relationship, so it might be helpful to explore why you feel this way and what changes you would like to make. It might also be beneficial to talk about how you feel about being in an online relationship versus an in-person one. Talking through these feelings could help you decide which path feels right for you and your family."}
{"user": "I'm struggling with addiction, and I can't seem to find the strength to fight it on my own. What advice can you give me?", "therapist": "It sounds like you are struggling with an uphill battle. It is important that you recognize your strengths and weaknesses in order to build up your self-confidence. You could also try reaching out to a support group or therapists who specialize in addiction, as well as building a strong foundation of trust with a sponsor. Above all else, remember that you are capable of making it through this and taking back control of your life."}
