 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "Every time I speak, he says I anger him. Also, when he’s mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me. I feel like we’re so distant from each other now. We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in. What should I do? We've been married for two years but together for seven.", "therapist": "It sounds like you are feeling frustrated and disconnected from your husband. It might be helpful to have a conversation with him about what is causing the negative feelings, and how both of you can work on rebuilding the connection between you. By understanding his triggers and being able to communicate more effectively, you can create a stronger foundation and resolve any issues before they arise." }
