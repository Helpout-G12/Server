 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?", "therapist": "It sounds like you are putting a lot of effort into your life and making an honest effort to improve yourself. It is understandable that this can be overwhelming and discouraging if nothing seems to change no matter how hard one tries. Have you tried talking to someone who could offer a fresh perspective? Sometimes just having someone listen and acknowledge our struggles helps us gain new insights." }
