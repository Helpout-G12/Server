 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the "perfect guy"? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?", "therapist": "I understand that you are in a long distance relationship and feeling attracted to other men than your partner. It is natural to feel this way since it is human nature to be attracted to people we find physically attractive. In terms of what to do next, I would suggest that you evaluate the relationship from all angles and make sure it is healthy and happy for both of you. When relationships are based on mutual understanding and respect, then it can work out even if physical attraction wanes over time. If things are not as equal in your relationship, then you may want to re-evaluate and decide what is best for the both of you.", "user": "Thank you for understanding my feelings. I appreciate that this is normal human behavior and it's helpful to know that it is possible for a relationship to work if it is based on mutual understanding and respect."}
