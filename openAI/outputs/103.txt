 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why. For me it seemed out of the blue. I don't miss her as much as I used to but I just don't trust people anymore, not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family. I'm so terrified of being judged or dismissed. Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, I've just shut down. I haven't felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart. I'm scared to because I don't want it to be taken away from me again. I feel like ever lesson I learn only last a day. I just don't know what to do. I'm working at a place I know I should enjoy. I'm keeping up with my creative passions: working out, eating healthy, etc. I'm doing everything the books say I should do, but I don't feel any different. I just don't know what to do.", "therapist": "I understand how difficult this must be for you. It can be very difficult to trust people after going through something painful like this. Have you tried reaching out to your friends and family to let them know what youâ€™re going through? It might help to talk about it and have their support. As far as feeling comfortable and happy with yourself, I would recommend exploring ways to practice self-care. Make sure you are eating nutritious meals, getting enough sleep, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. Taking the time for yourself is important too, so try setting aside some time each day to do something that brings you peace and relaxation. I'm here if you need anyone to talk to. It might help to explore your thoughts and feelings with a therapist as well."}
