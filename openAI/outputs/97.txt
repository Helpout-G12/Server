They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.", "therapist": "I am so sorry for your loss. It's understandable that this experience has caused you to feel disconnected from your girlfriend. Is there anything specific that triggered the intimacy issues? Do you have any ideas of how to reconnect with her?"}
