 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that Iâ€™m an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety.", "therapist": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be very difficult for you. What are some of the ways your anxiety manifests?", "user": "The anxiety affects my daily life and causes panic attacks. I often have difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as feeling physically ill sometimes."}

Answer: The therapist listens and offers empathy and understanding while the patient continues to open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I find it hard to trust people since the rape happened.", "therapist": "That must be very difficult for you. I'm sure there are things that have helped you feel more secure, like joining support groups or seeking professional help."}
