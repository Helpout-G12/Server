 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I'm going through a divorce with my wife of three years, who I've known since the 4th grade and been involved with for seven years! We just had a baby seven months ago and never got along with my mother, who I've lived with for years. I am now back with my mother because I have nowhere to go with this divorce looming. I'm heart broken because I fell into a depression, I haven't seen my child in a while, I'm having good and bad dreams, and I feel hated. Can you help? Can you intervene? Can I speak with someone?", "therapist": "I understand how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like it has been a long road of heartbreak and sadness. It is important to take care of yourself during this time, and reach out if you need additional help or support. I am here for you if you want to talk more about how you are feeling and any thoughts or worries that come up in the meantime."}
