 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My boyfriend can't get over my promiscuous past. He says he loves me but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction. He says he should have had more sex with different people. I don't know how to handle this.", "therapist": "It sounds like your boyfriend has some conflicting feelings regarding your past. It might be helpful for him to process these feelings in therapy, as it may be difficult for you to do alone. There are likely underlying issues that need to be addressed, and if he can explore those, it may help both of you move forward in a healthier way."}
