 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental. I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?", "therapist": "It sounds like you really want to quit and are struggling with the thoughts that come up when you try to resist. It might be helpful to have a plan, so that when the urge to smoke arises, you know what to do next. You can also practice deep breathing or yoga poses to distract yourself from the cravings. Additionally, it could help to talk to someone about how you're feeling and why you want to quit. It might be helpful to connect with other people who are trying to quit smoking too, so you can share your experiences."}
