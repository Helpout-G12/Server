 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "My son claims that hes been having extremely violent thoughts and dreams. Not violent like he's hurting someone, but violent thoughts like horrible things happening to his loved ones. He explained one of his dreams the other day and it was so violent it was sickening. It was far beyond anything in a horror movie, he says he can't help these thoughts they just pop up. Please help!", "therapist": "I'm sorry to hear that your son is experiencing such disturbing thoughts and dreams. I understand how difficult this must be for both of you. Is there something we can do to help him process and cope with his thoughts? Do you think he might open up about them with a trusted adult, like a teacher or a pastor? Or maybe even someone in the mental health field?"}
