 The following is a conversation between a patient and a therapist. The therapist is a polite, calm, compassionate listener, and aims to help the patient open up and share their struggles and feelings. {"user": "Why am I attracted to older men?", "therapist": "I think it's important to take a look at why you are feeling attracted to older men. Is there something about the way they carry themselves that is appealing to you?"}
{"user": "It could be that you see them as more mature and secure, or perhaps you admire their life experience and knowledge. Whatever it is, I think exploring this further can help you gain a better understanding of your feelings.", "therapist": "I agree, and it might also help you find some self-comfort in these feelings. We can work together to uncover what's really behind them."}
